                                    Preface

            This volume presents the final results of the 1989 Benchmark
Survey of U.S. Direct Investment Abroad, conducted by the Bureau of Economic
Analysis (BEA), U.S. Department of Commerce.  Benchmark surveys are the
Bureau's most comprehensive surveys--both in terms of companies covered and
information gathered.  The 1989 survey covered the universe of U.S. direct
investment abroad, which consists of all foreign business enterprises owned 10
percent or more, directly or indirectly, by a U.S. person.  The last benchmark
survey covered 1982.

            The survey collected detailed data on the financial structure and
operations of U.S. parent companies and their foreign affiliates in 1989.  The
data include balance sheets, income statements, sales of goods and services,
employment and employee compensation, U.S. merchandise trade, research and
development expenditures, and, for foreign affiliates, external financial
position.  The survey also collected data on the U.S. direct investment
position abroad and on balance of payments transactions between U.S. parents
and their foreign affiliates in fiscal year 1989.  The data for U.S. parent
companies are disaggregated by industry of parent.  The data for foreign
affiliates are disaggregated by country and industry of affiliate or by
industry of U.S. parent.

            Some data presented here, such as investment income, were
collected for the first time in the 1989 benchmark survey.  Other data--such
as employment of U.S. parents by industry of sales, U.S. merchandise trade of
parents and affiliates by product and by destination or origin, compensation
of and hours worked by production workers of manufacturing affiliates, sales
by affiliates by country of destination, and research and development
expenditures of parents and affiliates--were collected in the last (1982)
benchmark survey, but not in the related annual surveys for nonbenchmark
years. 

                                Acknowledgments

            BEA thanks the staffs of U.S. companies that responded to the 1989
benchmark survey for their efforts in completing and filing reports and for
their cooperation with BEA during processing and review of the data.

            Jack J. Bame, Associate Director for International Economics,
succeeded by J. Steven Landefeld, provided general guidance for the survey. 
Betty L. Barker, Chief, and R. David Belli, Assistant Chief, International
Investment Division (IID), directed the design of the benchmark survey report
forms, the conduct of the survey, and the analysis and publication of the
results.

            The Direct Investment Abroad Branch (DIAB) of IID, under the
direction of Patricia C. Walker, was primarily responsible for conducting the
survey.  David H. Galler, Chief of the Annual and Benchmark Surveys Section of
DIAB, supervised the editing and processing of the reports.  He also designed
the computer edit checks and the forms and processing control systems. 

            The following former and current members of DIAB processed and
edited the survey: Joan O. Adams, Margaret Buckley, Barbara S. Clark, Margo A.
Collier, Emily D. Curry, Marcia S. Francis, David N. Hale, Jeanne Hicks,
Barbara Hubbard, Lonnie Hunter, Deanna D. Ibarra, Christine J. Lee, Sherry
Lee, Stephanie A. Lewis, Leila C. Morrison, Juanita L. Mortimer, John A. Munz,
Pearl Rivers, Ronald L. Ross, William R. Shupe, Robert N. Smith, Dwayne
Torney, and Diann L. Vann.

            Jeffrey H. Lowe and Raymond J. Mataloni, Jr., of the Research
Branch of IID, under the direction of Obie G. Whichard, assisted DIAB staff in
reviewing the results for consistency and accuracy.  Arnold Gilbert of the
Data Retrieval and Analysis Branch (DRAB) of IID also assisted in the review. 

            James T. Spalding, Chief, Programming and Analysis Branch of the
Computer Systems and Services Division, coordinated the computer programming
and data  conversion and processing activities, which were performed by
Douglas J. Klear, Elizabeth L. Shumate, Marguerite E. Ellis, Effie M. Eason,
and Janice E. Townsend.

            Marie Colosimo designed the computer programs for the integrated
master file of U.S. direct investment abroad.  Arnold Gilbert designed the
programs for data estimation, final review of the data, suppression of the
data for confidentiality reasons, and generation of the tables for
publication.  They were under the supervision of Smith W. Allnutt, Chief of
DRAB.  

            Jeffrey H. Lowe prepared the text and coordinated the design of
the tables for this publication. 

            Eric B. Manning, under the guidance of Leland L. Scott, Chief of
the Publication Services Branch, Current Business Analysis Division,
coordinated the production of the publication and provided typesetting.  W.
Ronnie Foster designed the cover.

                                 Introduction

     Data in this publication are from BEA's BE-10 Benchmark Survey of U.S.
Direct Investment Abroad--1989.  Reporting in the survey was mandatory under
the International Investment and Trade in Services Survey Act (P.L. 94-472, 90
Stat. 2059, 22 U.S.C. 3101 through 3108, as amended by P.L. 98-573).

     The publication presents 263 tables that contain nearly all of the data
collected in the benchmark survey.  Some tables present data for several
related items disaggregated by country or by industry; others present data for
a single item disaggregated by country (or industry) and cross-classified by
industry (or country).

     The amount and type of data collected in the survey differed depending on
whether the U.S. parents or foreign affiliates were banks or nonbanks and, for
nonbank affiliates, on whether they were majority or minority owned.  In this
publication, data for foreign affiliates and for their U.S. parents are
presented separately for five affiliate groups:  (1) All affiliates of all
U.S. parents, (2) nonbank affiliates of nonbank U.S. parents, (3)
majority-owned nonbank affiliates of nonbank U.S. parents, (4) nonbank
affiliates of U.S. parents in banking, and (5) bank affiliates of all U.S.
parents.  Data for other groups are not presented, primarily because of space
and resource constraints. 

     Three related types of data are presented:  (1) Foreign affiliate
financial and operating data, (2) U.S. parent financial and operating data,
and (3) direct investment position and balance of payments data.  Financial
and operating data cover balance sheets and income statements; property,
plant, and equipment; employment and employee compensation; U.S. merchandise
trade; sales of goods and services; technology; taxes; and, for foreign
affiliates, external financial position.  The direct investment position and
balance of payments data cover positions and transactions between foreign
affiliates and their U.S. parents.  Thus, they are the intersection of the
financial and operating data of the foreign affiliates with those of their
U.S. parents.  They are used in deriving the official estimates of U.S. direct
investment abroad that enter the U.S. balance of payments accounts (formally
referred to as the U.S. international transactions accounts), the U.S.
national income and product accounts (NIPA's), and the U.S. international
investment position (IIP).  Balance of payments data include data on capital
flows between U.S. parents and their foreign affiliates, receipts of income by
U.S. parents from their foreign affiliates, and U.S. parents' receipts and
payments of royalties and license fees and fees for other services from and to
their foreign affiliates.  The income and direct investment position
data collected in the benchmark survey and shown in this publication are on a
historical-cost basis; prior to their inclusion in the international accounts,
the NIPA's, and the IIP, they are adjusted to reflect current-period prices.  

          The data in this publication revise data that appeared in U.S.
Direct Investment Abroad: 1989 Benchmark Survey, Preliminary Results and that
were summarized in "U.S. Direct Investment Abroad: 1989 Benchmark Survey
Results" in the October 1991 issue of the Survey of Current Business.

     The financial and operating data for 1989 in this publication update
estimates for 1983-88 and 1990 contained in other BEA publications.  (The
estimates for all years are also available on computer diskette; ordering
information for the publications and diskettes is at the back of this
publication.)  For similar items, the 1989 universe data in this publication
are generally comparable with the universe estimates for the other years,
which were derived from sample data reported in BEA's annual survey of U.S.
direct investment abroad.  Some data presented here, such as investment
income, were collected for the first time in the 1989 benchmark survey.  Other
data--such as employment of U.S. parents by industry of sales, U.S.
merchandise trade of parents and affiliates by product and by destination or
origin, compensation of and hours worked by production workers of
manufacturing affiliates, sales by affiliates by country of destination, and
research and development expenditures of parents and affiliates--were
collected in the last (1982) benchmark survey, but not in the annual surveys
for nonbenchmark years. 

     To aid comparisons of the financial and operating data for the various
years, table 1 provides cross-references between the table numbers used in
this publication, the publications for 1983-88, and the publications for 1990
and future years.  Many of the tables that appear in this publication do not
have counterparts in the publications for 1983-88 and for 1990 forward,
primarily because the 1989 benchmark survey collected data for several items
not obtained in the annual surveys for the other years.  If a comparable table
for the other years is not available, no table numbers appear in table 1 in
the columns for the other years' publications.

     In some instances, data items collected separately in the benchmark
survey may have been combined with other items in the annual survey.  Thus,
two or more items that were combined in a table in the annual survey
publications may be shown separately in a table in this publication.  In a few
instances, the opposite is true; that is, some items that were collected
separately in the annual survey were combined in the benchmark survey and are
shown together in this publication. 
 
                                   Coverage

     A 1989 benchmark survey report was required from every U.S. person (as
defined below) having a foreign affiliate--that is, having direct or indirect
ownership or control of 10 percent or more of the voting securities of an
incorporated foreign business enterprise or an equivalent interest in an
unincorporated foreign business enterprise--at any time during its 1989 fiscal
year.  Reports were required even though the foreign business enterprise may
have been established, acquired, liquidated, sold, or otherwise inactivated
during the year.

     Each BE-10 report consisted of (1) Form BE-10A, which obtained data for
the U.S. parent company, and (2) one or more Forms BE-10B, which obtained data
for each of the parent's foreign affiliates that had total assets, sales, or
net income (or loss) of at least $3 million or that owned another foreign
affiliate for which a form BE-1OB had to be filed, regardless of the size of
its own assets, sales, or net income (or loss).  On a supplement to Form
BE-1OA, U.S. parents had to list all foreign affiliates that were exempt from
being reported on Form BE-10B and give a few selected data items--percentage
ownership, total assets, sales, net income, and direct investment
position--for each.  If all foreign affiliates of a U.S. parent were exempt
from being reported on Form BE-10B, the U.S. parent was still required to file
a Form BE-10A, but only Part I, items 1-4 (to identify itself) and the Form
BE-10A Supplement (to identify its exempt foreign affiliates).

     U.S. parents and foreign affiliates in banking--that is, parents and
affiliates that had over 50 percent of their total revenues generated by
activities classified in the banking industry--were permitted to report less
detailed financial and operating data than nonbank parents and affiliates. 
Less detail was required because most of the information on bank parents and
affiliates that was needed for policymaking purposes already had to be
reported to other U.S. Government agencies.  Shorter, specialized forms for
bank parents (Form BE-10A BANK) and for bank affiliates (Form BE-1OB BANK)
were substituted for the standard forms.  The reporting criteria for banks,
however, were the same as those for nonbanks, except that foreign bank
affiliates that were owned indirectly 50 percent or less by their U.S. parents
and that did not own another foreign affiliate for which a Form BE-10B had to
be filed were exempt from being reported, even if their total assets, sales,
or net income (or loss) were $3 million or more.

     Based on the above criteria, complete BE-10A forms were filed by 2,272 
U.S. parents, of which 89 were banks; 723 U.S. parents filed only partial
BE-10A forms because all their foreign affiliates were exempt.  BE-10B forms
were received for 18,899 foreign affiliates, of which 729 were banks; 8,187
foreign affiliates were listed by their U.S. parents as exempt from being
reported on Form BE-1OB.

     In table 2, foreign affiliates for which BE-1OB forms were filed are
compared with all foreign affiliates in the 1989 direct investment universe. 
Affiliates for which BE-1OB forms were filed accounted for 69.8 percent of the
universe in terms of numbers.  However, because of the relatively low
exemption level on the form, they accounted for almost the entire universe in
terms of value--99.7 percent of total assets, 99.6 percent of sales, 99.9
percent of net income, and 99.4 percent of the historical-cost U.S. direct
investment position abroad.  Thus, in value terms, coverage of the universe is
virtually complete.

     Nonbank affiliates for which BE-10B forms were filed accounted for 99.6
percent of total assets, 99.6 percent of sales, 99.9 percent of net income,
and 99.4 percent of the historical-cost U.S. direct investment position of the
nonbank affiliate universe.  The corresponding percentages for bank affiliates
were 100.0, 100.0, 100.1, and 99.8 percent, respectively.  Bank affiliates for
which BE-10B BANK forms were filed accounted for more than 100 percent of net
income because exempt foreign affiliates had, in aggregate, a net loss for the
year.

     Except for table 2, all tables in this publication cover only foreign
affiliates for which BE-10B forms were filed, and their U.S. parents.  Thus,
when the term "all foreign affiliates" is used, it refers to all foreign
affiliates for which BE-10B forms were filed, not to the universe of
affiliates shown in table 2. 

                        Basic Concepts and Definitions

     This section describes the basic concepts and definitions used in the
1989 benchmark survey.  Major differences between these concepts and
definitions and those used in BEA's last benchmark survey, which covered 1982,
and in other BEA surveys of U.S. direct investment abroad since 1982 are
noted.

Direct investment 

     Direct investment implies that a person in one country has a lasting
interest in, and a degree of influence over the management of, a business
enterprise in another country.  For the United States, ownership or control by
a single person of 10 percent or more of an enterprise's voting securities, or
the equivalent, is considered evidence of such a lasting interest or degree of
influence over management.  Thus, U.S. direct investment abroad is the
ownership or control, directly or indirectly, by one U.S. person of 10 percent
or more of the voting securities of an incorporated foreign business
enterprise or an equivalent interest in an unincorporated foreign business
enterprise.  Any U.S. investment abroad that is not direct investment by this
definition was not covered by the 1989 benchmark survey.

     Direct investment refers to ownership by a single person, not to the
combined ownership of all persons in a country.  "Person" is broadly defined
to include any individual, branch, partnership, associated group, association,
estate, trust, corporation or other organization (whether or not organized
under the laws of any State), and any government (including a foreign
government, the U.S. Government, a State or local government, and any agency,
corporation or financial institution, or other entity or instrumentality
thereof, including a government-sponsored agency).  This definition treats an
associated group as a single person.  An associated group consists of two or
more persons who--by the appearance of their actions, by agreement, or by an
understanding--exercise their voting privileges in a concerted manner to
influence the management of a business enterprise.  The following are deemed
to be associated groups: (1) Members of the same family, (2) a business
enterprise and one or more of its officers and directors, (3) members of a
syndicate or joint venture, and (4) a corporation and its domestic
subsidiaries.  Even if each member of such an associated group owns less than
10 percent of a business enterprise, as long as all members combined own at
least 10 percent, direct investment is considered to exist.  The members of
the group are considered to influence or control management in a manner
comparable to that of a single person with the same total ownership interest.

     Because direct investment is defined from a single-owner viewpoint,
investment by a U.S. person of less than 10 percent in a foreign business
enterprise is not considered direct investment, even if another U.S. person
has an interest of a least 10 percent, unless both U.S. persons are members of
an associated group.  Thus, if one U.S. person owns 11 percent and another
owns 9 percent, the 11-percent interest is included, but the 9-percent
interest is excluded.  The person with the less-than-10-percent interest, by
itself, is not considered to have sufficient ownership to influence
management.
     A U.S. person's direct investment ownership interest in a foreign
business enterprise may be held directly or indirectly or both.  It is held
directly if the U.S. person itself holds the ownership interest in the foreign
business enterprise.  It is held indirectly if the U.S. person holds an
ownership interest in another foreign business enterprise that, in turn,
directly or indirectly owns the given foreign business enterprise.  Any number
of tiers of ownership may intervene between a direct investor and an
indirectly owned enterprise.  A U.S. person's percentage of indirect voting
ownership in a given foreign business enterprise is equal to the direct voting
ownership percentage of the U.S. person in the first foreign business
enterprise in the ownership chain, times that first enterprise's direct
ownership percentage in the second enterprise in the chain, times the
corresponding percentages for all other intervening enterprises in the chain,
times the last intervening enterprise's direct ownership percentage in the
given foreign business enterprise.  If more than one ownership chain between a
U.S. person and a given foreign business enterprise exists, the percentages of
direct and indirect ownership in all chains are summed to determine the U.S.
person's direct investment ownership percentage.

     Only ownership percentages in the portion of an ownership chain that
extends from the U.S. border outward enter into the above calculation. 
Ownership percentages in any portion of the chain that either reenters or
falls entirely within the United States do not enter into the calculation.

Determination of residency

     The "United States" means the 50 States, the District of Columbia, the
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and all U.S. territories and possessions. 
"Foreign" means that which is situated outside the United States, or which
belongs to or is characteristic of a country other than the United States.  A
U.S. person is any person resident in, or subject to the jurisdiction of, the
United States, and a foreign person is any person resident outside the United
States or subject to the jurisdiction of a country other than the United
States.  Thus, in determining whether a direct investor or the business
enterprise owned by a direct investor is a U.S. or foreign person, country of
residence, not country of citizenship, is used.

     Individuals are considered residents of, or subject to the jurisdiction
of, the country in which they are physically located, as long as they reside
or expect to reside in the country for 1 year or more.  Under this rule,
individuals who reside or expect to reside outside their country of
citizenship for less than 1 year are considered residents of their country of
citizenship, whereas individuals who reside or expect to reside outside their
country of citizenship for 1 year or more are, with two exceptions, considered
residents of the country in which they are residing.  One exception is an
owner or employee of a business enterprise who is residing outside the
enterprise's country of location in order to further its business and who is a
citizen of the country in which the enterprise is located.  In this case, the
owner or employee is considered a resident of the country of citizenship, even
if he or she is outside that country for 1 year or more, as long as he or she
intends to return in a reasonable period of time.  The other exception is that
individuals and members of their immediate families who reside outside their
country of citizenship as a result of employment by the government of that
country--such as diplomats, consular officials, or members of the armed
forces--are considered residents of their country of citizenship regardless of
their length of stay elsewhere.

The U.S. parent

     A U.S. parent is a U.S. person who has direct investment--that is, a
10-percent-or-more direct or indirect ownership interest--in a foreign
business enterprise.  If incorporated, the U.S. parent is the fully
consolidated U.S. enterprise that consists of (1) the U.S. parent corporation
whose voting securities are not owned more than 50 percent by another U.S.
corporation, and (2) proceeding down each ownership chain from that U.S.
corporation, any U.S. corporation (including Foreign Sales Corporations
located within the United States) whose voting securities are more than 50
percent owned by the U.S. corporation above it.  All other U.S. corporations
and all foreign business enterprises owned by the U.S. parent are excluded
from the full consolidation.

     In the 1982 benchmark survey and the annual surveys through 1987,
majority-owned (that is, more-than-50-percent-owned) domestic subsidiaries of
a U.S. parent that were normally excluded from the parent's full consolidation
in reports to stockholders--because, for example, the subsidiary was a finance
company but the parent was a manufacturer or because the subsidiary's
operations were otherwise unrelated to those of the parent--were treated as
separate U.S. parent companies and were permitted to file separate reports. 
Beginning with the annual survey covering 1988, BEA required that U.S. parents
file a single consolidated BE-10A form.  This requirement was instituted
following the adoption in October 1987 of Financial Accounting Standards Board
Statement Number 94, which stipulated that all majority-owned subsidiaries
should be consolidated in financial statements for fiscal years ending on or
after December 15, 1988.    

     A U.S. parent is a "person" in the broad sense defined above.  Thus, it
may be a business enterprise; a religious, charitable, or other nonprofit
organization; an individual; a government; an estate or trust; etc.  Most U.S.
parents, however, are business enterprises.  A business enterprise is any
organization, association, branch, venture, or the ownership of any real
estate that exists to make a profit or to otherwise secure economic advantage.

     Where a U.S. individual or other nonbusiness person (such as a nonprofit
organization or a government) owns more than 50 percent of a U.S. business
enterprise that, in turn, owns a foreign business enterprise, the U.S.
business enterprise, not the individual or other nonbusiness person, is
considered the parent.  This treatment ensures that financial and operating
data of the U.S. business enterprise are included in the U.S. parent data and
that data on the transactions and positions of the U.S. business enterprise
with the foreign business enterprise are included in the foreign affiliate
data reported to BEA.  Any direct transactions or positions of the individual
or other nonbusiness person with the foreign business enterprise must be
reported by the U.S. business enterprise and are, therefore, also included in
the direct investment accounts.

     Although the U.S. Government may have equity investment in a foreign
business enterprise, such investment is not covered by BEA's direct investment
surveys.  Data on such investment are reported to other agencies and are
included by BEA in the U.S. Government accounts, rather than in the direct
investment accounts, of the U.S. balance of payments.

     In the case of a U.S. estate, the estate itself, not its beneficiary, is
considered the U.S. parent.  For a U.S. trust, however, either the beneficiary
or the creator of the trust may be considered the U.S. parent with respect to
any investments of the trust, depending on the circumstances.  The creator is
considered the parent if there is a reversionary interest--that is, if the
interest in the trust may be returned to the creator after a period of 
time--or if the creator is a corporation or other organization that designates
its own shareholders or members as beneficiaries.  In all other cases, the
beneficiary is considered the parent.

The foreign affiliate

     A foreign affiliate is a foreign business enterprise in which there is
U.S. direct investment--that is, it is a foreign business enterprise that is
directly or indirectly owned or controlled by one U.S. person to the extent of
10 percent or more of the voting securities for an incorporated business
enterprise or an equivalent interest for an unincorporated business
enterprise.  The affiliate is called a foreign affiliate to denote that it is
located outside the United States (although the direct investment interest in
it is owned by a U.S. person).

     A business enterprise, and therefore an affiliate, may be either
incorporated or unincorporated.  Unincorporated business enterprises include
branches and partnerships. 

     A branch consists of operations or activities in one location that a
person in a second location conducts in its own name, rather than through an
entity incorporated in the first location.  For example, if a person in
country X carries out operations in country Y in its own name, rather than by
incorporating the operations in country Y, the country-Y operations are
considered a branch.  By definition, a branch is wholly owned.  A branch
located abroad but owned by a U.S. person is a foreign affiliate of the U.S.
person.  If a company is incorporated in the United States but carries out
substantially all of its operations abroad, its foreign operations are treated
by BEA as a branch (and, therefore, as a foreign affiliate) even though the
U.S. company itself may consider the operations to be an integral part of, and
would normally consolidate them with, its own operations and accounts.

     In general, a U.S. person's foreign operations or activities are
considered a foreign affiliate if they are legally or functionally separable
from the domestic operations or activities of the U.S. person.  In most cases,
it is clear whether the foreign operations or activities constitute an
affiliate.  For example, if the operation or activity is incorporated
abroad--as is true in the majority of cases--it is always considered a foreign
affiliate.  Even if it is unincorporated, the foreign operation or activity is
usually legally or functionally separable from the U.S. person's domestic
operations or activities.  In cases where it is not clearly separable, the
determination of whether the operation or activity constitutes a foreign
affiliate is made on a case-by-case basis, depending on the weight of the
evidence.

     The following factors indicate that the operation or activity is probably
a foreign affiliate: 

  1. It pays foreign income taxes.
  2. It has a substantial physical presence abroad, as evidenced by plant and
     equipment or by employees that are permanently located abroad.
  3. Separate financial records are kept on the foreign activity or operation
     that would allow preparation of financial statements, including a balance
     sheet and income statement, for it.  (A mere record of disbursements to,
     or receipts from, the foreign activity would not constitute a "financial
     statement" for this purpose.)
  4. It takes title to the goods it sells and receives revenues therefrom, or
     it receives funds for its own account from customers for services it    
     performs.
     The following factors indicate that the operation or activity is probably
not a foreign affiliate: 
  1. It engages only in sales promotion or public relations activities on 
     behalf of the U.S. person.
  2. It conducts business abroad for the U.S. person's account but not for its
     own account.
  3. It has no separate financial statements.
  4. All of its expenses are paid by the U.S. person. 
  5. It pays no foreign income taxes.
  6. It has limited physical assets abroad or no employees permanently located
     abroad.

     Foreign stations, ticket offices, and terminal or port facilities of a
U.S. airline or ship operator that provide services only to the airline's or
ship operator's own operations are not considered foreign affiliates and are
excluded from U.S. direct investment abroad.  The reason is that most of the
revenues--such as passenger fares and freight charges--collected by these
facilities are generated by the travel and transportation services rendered by
the airline or ship operator of which they are a part, not by the activities
of these facilities per se.  However, if the facilities provide services
primarily to unaffiliated persons, rather than to the U.S. airline or ship
operator that owns them, they are considered foreign affiliates and are
included in direct investment.

     Ownership of real estate for profit-making purposes is defined to be a
business enterprise, but ownership of real estate held exclusively for
personal use is not.  The latter is exempt from being reported in BEA direct
investment surveys and is excluded from the data in this publication.  A
primary residence abroad that is leased to others while the owner is a U.S.
resident but that the owner intends to reoccupy is considered real estate held
for personal use.

     In the benchmark survey, each foreign affiliate had to be reported
separately unless the recordkeeping system of the affiliate made this
impossible or extremely difficult.  In that case, an affiliate could have been
consolidated with other foreign affiliates in the same country if the
affiliates were also in the same three-digit industry or were integral parts
of the same business operation.  (As an example of the latter, if German
affiliate A manufactured tires and a majority of its sales were to German
affiliate B, which manufactured autos, then affiliates A and B could have been
consolidated.)  Under no circumstances could affiliates in different countries
be consolidated; this rule permits affiliates and their data to be classified
by individual country.

                             Accounting Principles

Use of generally accepted accounting principles

     In the benchmark survey, data were required to be reported as they would
have been for purposes of preparing stockholders' reports, rather than for tax
or other purposes.  Thus, U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)
were followed unless otherwise indicated by the survey instructions.  The
survey instructions departed from GAAP in cases where the departure would have
resulted in data that were conceptually or analytically more useful or more
appropriate for direct investment purposes.  The major departure from GAAP was
the use of the unique consolidation rules discussed earlier for affiliates and
U.S. parents.  

Translation adjustments and other capital gains and losses

     Monetary amounts were reported to BEA in U.S. dollars.  The report forms
specified that when a foreign affiliate's assets, liabilities, revenues, and
expenses were denominated or measured on the affiliate's financial statements
in a foreign currency, they must be translated into dollars in accordance with
GAAP, specifically Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 52 (FASB
52).

     Under FASB 52, all assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses are
translated at current exchange rates.  For assets and liabilities, the
exchange rate as of the balance sheet date is used.  For revenues and
expenses, weighted-average exchange rates for the period are used.  Under FASB
52, exchange gains and losses resulting from remeasuring the foreign
affiliates' foreign-currency-denominated assets and liabilities into the
affiliates' principal, or functional, currency at exchange rates that differ
from those used in the prior period are included in net income.  However,
exchange gains and losses that result from translating opening balances for
foreign affiliates' assets and liabilities from the functional currency into
U.S. dollars at exchange rates different from those for closing balances are
excluded from affiliates' net income; they are instead taken directly to a
separate component of owners' equity, entitled "translation adjustments."  The
effects of translating foreign affiliates' revenues and expenses from their
functional currency into U.S. dollars at exchange rates different from those
in the prior period are reflected in net income, but they are not separately
identified and, because they do not represent changes in the values of assets
or liabilities, are not regarded as capital gains or losses.  (For a more
complete description of translation procedures, refer to FASB 52.)

     Prior to 1990, direct investment income for balance of payments purposes
included translation adjustments and all other capital gains and losses,
whether or not they were included in net income for income statement purposes. 
In June 1990, translation adjustments were removed from direct investment
income for balance of payments purposes, and in June 1992, all other capital
gains and losses were removed.  (Estimates of direct investment income
excluding all capital gains and losses are available for years beginning with
1982; for more details, see the section on direct investment income.)  Capital
gains and losses have been excluded in order to make direct investment income
for balance of payments purposes more closely reflect income from
operations--the concept of income used in the U.S. national income and product
accounts.

                             Fiscal Year Reporting

     Data for foreign affiliates and U.S. parents were required to be reported
on a fiscal year basis.  The 1989 fiscal year was defined as the affiliate's
or parent's financial reporting year that ended in calendar year 1989.        

     The fiscal year data from the benchmark survey are not comparable with
the calendar year estimates of transactions between foreign affiliates and
their U.S. parents that appear in the U.S. balance of payments accounts or
with the calendar year estimates of the U.S. direct investment position abroad
on a historical-cost basis.  Thus, the 1989 benchmark survey data on
transactions and positions between U.S. parents and their foreign affiliates
will not be entered directly into the balance of payments accounts, the IIP,
or the NIPA's; rather, they will first be adjusted to a calendar year basis. 
The adjusted data are scheduled to be published in the June and August 1993
issues of the Survey of Current Business.  The fiscal year balance of payments
and direct investment position data are, however, presented in this
publication because they are comparable with the fiscal year financial and
operating data from the benchmark survey.   

     The extent of noncomparability between the benchmark survey data
presented here and the direct investment estimates that will appear in the
balance of payments and IIP depends, in part, on the number and size of
foreign affiliates and U.S. parents whose fiscal years do not correspond to
the calendar year.  Table 3 shows the number of, and selected data items for,
foreign affiliates and U.S. parents, classified by the affiliate's or parent's
fiscal-year ending date.  Table 4 shows the number and total assets of foreign
affiliates further disaggregated by industry and by country of affiliate and
cross-classified by the affiliate's fiscal-year ending date, and table 5 shows
the number and total assets of U.S. parents further disaggregated by industry
of U.S. parent and cross-classified by the parent's fiscal-year ending date.  

     In 1989, only 59.2 percent of foreign affiliates and 61.2 percent of U.S.
parents had fiscal years that corresponded exactly to the calendar year.  In
most cases, however, these affiliates' and parents' shares of the reported
data of all affiliates and parents were considerably higher.  For example,
their shares of assets were 79.5 and 87.9 percent, and their shares of sales
69.5 and 76.8 percent, respectively.  Thus, affiliates and parents whose
fiscal years did not correspond to the calendar year accounted for
proportionately smaller shares of the reported data than their numbers might
imply.  However, the actual difference between the data they reported in the
benchmark survey and the data they would have reported if they had been on a
calendar year basis is unknown.

                                Confidentiality

     Under the International Investment and Trade in Services Survey Act, the
direct investment data collected by BEA are confidential; thus, they cannot be
published "in such a manner that the person to whom the information relates
can be specifically identified."  Access to the data is limited to officials
and employees (including consultants, contractors, and their employees) of the
U.S. Government agencies that are specifically designated by the President to
perform functions under the act.  The act further specifies that the
information collected under it must be used for statistical and analytical
purposes only.  For example, use of an individual company's data for tax,
investigative, or regulatory purposes is prohibited. 

     Data in the tables in this publication were suppressed (that is, not
shown) if showing them might disclose the data for individual companies.  In
addition to suppressing data cells that if published would constitute a
disclosure of confidential data (primary suppressions), it is often necessary
to suppress other cells (secondary suppressions) that, by subtraction from a
common total or subtotal, could be used to derive the primary suppressed cell
in the same or a related table.  A "(D)" entered in a data cell indicates that
the data were suppressed for confidentiality reasons.

              Classification of Data by Country and by Industry 

Country classification 

     Each foreign affiliate is classified by its country of location--that is,
the country in which the affiliate's physical assets are located or in which
its primary activity is carried out.  In most cases, the country of location
of a business enterprise is the same as its country of organization or
incorporation.  However, in some cases, a business enterprise is incorporated
in one country, but part or all of its physical assets are located, or its
activities carried out, in a second country.  If all its physical assets or
operations are located in a single foreign country outside its country of
incorporation, the enterprise is treated as an incorporated foreign affiliate
in the country where its physical assets and operations are located.  If,
however, an enterprise has some physical assets or operations in each country,
it is considered two separate affiliates--an incorporated affiliate located in
the country of incorporation and an unincorporated affiliate (a branch)
located in the other country.

     There are two exceptions to these general rules.  First, if a business
enterprise incorporated in one foreign country has physical assets or
operations in more than one other foreign country, an incorporated foreign
affiliate is deemed to exist in the country of incorporation, even though the
enterprise may have no physical assets or operations in that country. 
Unincorporated foreign affiliates (branches) are deemed to exist in the other
foreign countries.  In effect, the affiliate in the country of incorporation
is considered a holding company whose assets are the equity it holds in the
unincorporated affiliates in the other countries.  Second, if a business
enterprise incorporated abroad by a U.S. person conducts its operations from,
and has all of its physical assets in, the United States, it is treated as an
incorporated foreign affiliate in the country of incorporation, even though it
has no operations or physical assets there.  This treatment ensures that the
foreign entity is reported to BEA.

     Balance of payments transactions involving a given affiliate are
classified in the affiliate's country of location, even when they are with a
third-country transactor rather than with the affiliate itself.   For example,
when a U.S. parent purchases an affiliate's capital stock from a person in a
country other than the affiliate's country of location, the resulting direct
investment capital flows are classified in the country of the affiliate
because such flows change the U.S. direct investment position in that country. 
(However, the associated settlement flows, which are included in other capital
accounts of the U.S. balance of payments, are likely to be classified in the
country of the foreign transactor.)

     Unless otherwise specified, the designation "by country" in a table title
in this publication indicates that the data in the table are disaggregated by
country of foreign affiliate.  If a different method of country disaggregation
is used, it is so specified in the table title; for example, trade data could 
be disaggregated either by country of affiliate or by country of origin or
destination.


     Table II.A1 presents selected data for all nonbank foreign affiliates of
nonbank U.S. parents, classified by country of affiliate; each individual
country in which U.S. direct investment in 1989 was reported is shown
separately and is grouped by geographic area.  (Table III.A1 presents similar
information for majority-owned affiliates.)  Primarily because of
confidentiality requirements, many countries could not be shown separately in
the other tables in this publication.  However, the individual countries
included in a country group shown in the other tables may be determined, and
their relative sizes assessed, by referring to table II.A1.

     In this publication, the "International" category consists of affiliates
that have operations spanning more than one country and that are engaged in
petroleum shipping, other water transportation, or offshore oil and gas
drilling.  Affiliates in these industries that have operations entirely in one
country are classified in that specific country.  Thus, an affiliate engaged
in shipping goods among countries is classified in "International," whereas
one engaged in local coastal or inland shipping is classified in the country
along whose coast or on whose waterways it is operating.  Similarly, an oil
rig that was moved from place to place during the year is classified in
"International," but one that was stationary for the entire year is classified
in the country where it was located.

     In the 1989 benchmark survey, the treatment of sales by affiliates
classified in "International" differed from that in past years.  Prior to
1989, all sales by these affiliates, including those to U.S. persons, were
classified as "local" sales (that is, as sales to persons in the affiliate's
country of location, which, in this case, was deemed to be "International"). 
Beginning with the 1989 benchmark survey, sales to U.S. persons are instead
classified as such, and all other sales by these affiliates are classified as
"local."  This change was made in order to reflect the true destination of the
sales to the United States and to make their treatment consistent with that of
U.S. balance of payments flows of these affiliates.  The effect of this change
is that $2,605 million in sales that previously were considered sales to
foreign persons are now regarded as sales to U.S. persons.  All of these sales
were of services.

     The country stubs and headings shown in this publication differ from
those shown in the past.  The country detail has been reorganized along
geographic lines; economic or political groupings, such as the European
Communities, are no longer shown in the body of the table but may be shown as
addenda.  Also, a few countries in which U.S. investment has declined
significantly were dropped, and several countries in which investment has
expanded significantly have been added.

Industry classification

     Each U.S. parent or foreign affiliate is classified by industry using a
three-stage procedure based on sales (or, for holding companies, on total
income). 

(1)  A given U.S. parent or foreign affiliate was classified in the major
     industry group that accounted for the largest percentage of its sales. 
     The major industry groups used for this purpose were (a) agriculture,
     forestry, and fishing, (b) mining, (c) petroleum, (d) construction, (e)
     manufacturing, (f) transportation, communication, and public utilities,
     (g) wholesale trade, (h) retail trade, (i) finance, insurance, and real
     estate, and (j) services.
(2)  Within the major industry group, the U.S. parent or foreign affiliate was
     then classified in the two-digit industry in which its sales were
     largest.  A two-digit industry was defined for this purpose to consist of
     all three-digit subindustries that have the same digits in the first two
     places of their three-digit code.
(3)  Within its two-digit industry, the U.S. parent or foreign affiliate was
     then classified in the three-digit subindustry in which its sales were
     largest.

     If, at any of these three stages, two or more categories accounted for
the same percentage of sales, classification was based on subjective judgment.

     This procedure ensured that the U.S. parent or foreign affiliate was not
assigned to a three-digit subindustry that was outside its major industry,
even if its sales in that subindustry exceeded its sales in the largest
three-digit subindustry within its major industry.  It also ensured that the
U.S. parent or foreign affiliate was not assigned to a three-digit subindustry
that was outside its two-digit industry, even if its sales in that subindustry
exceeded its sales in the largest subindustry within its two-digit
industry.  


     Unless otherwise specified, the designation "by industry" in the title of
a table in this publication indicates that the data in the table are
disaggregated (1) by industry of foreign affiliate, if the table presents
foreign affiliate financial and operating data or balance of payments and
direct investment position data, or (2) by industry of U.S. parent, if the
table presents U.S. parent financial and operating data.  If a different basis
of disaggregation is used, it is so specified in the table title--for example,
when affiliate data are disaggregated by industry of U.S. parent.

     A list and description of the industry codes used by BEA in the 1989
benchmark survey are found in the Guide to Industry and Foreign Trade
Classifications for International Surveys, which is reproduced in the
appendix.  These classifications are adapted from, but are less detailed than,
those in the Standard Industrial Classification Manual, 1987.  The direct 
investment data are collected at the enterprise level, and each enterprise is
classified in a single industry based on its major activity.  In contrast, the
Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) is designed for classifying
individual establishments (or plants) within an enterprise.  Because many
direct investment enterprises are engaged in a variety of industries, it is
not meaningful to classify their data in the maximum detail provided by the
SIC. 

     To conform to the SIC system, petroleum is not listed as a major industry
group in the Guide.  Rather, the three-digit subindustries within petroleum
are spread among the other major industries; for example, crude petroleum
extraction is in mining, petroleum refining is in manufacturing, and gasoline
service stations are in retail trade.  For direct investment classification
and publication purposes, however, these various petroleum subindustries are
pulled together as a separate major industry group, petroleum.

     U.S. parents that are individuals, estates, or trusts have been
classified in a separate industry, "nonbusiness entities, except government,"
which, in this publication, is treated as part of the major industry "finance,
insurance, and real estate."  This industry is included in tables that
disaggregate affiliate data from the BE-1OB forms by industry of U.S. parent. 
It is not included in tables containing U.S. parent financial and operating
data from the BE-1OA forms, because U.S. parents that were individuals,
estates, or trusts were not required to report financial and operating data.

     The industry classifications used in the 1989 benchmark survey differ
somewhat from those used in past BEA surveys.  As stated above, the 1989
classifications were adapted from, and reflect revisions embodied in, the 1987
SIC manual, whereas the classifications for past surveys were adapted from
earlier SIC manuals.  

     Table II.A2 presents selected data for all nonbank foreign affiliates and
all nonbank U.S. parents, classified by industry; each three-digit subindustry
(except for banking) is shown separately, grouped by the major industry to
which it belongs.  (Table III.A2 presents similar data for majority-owned
nonbank affiliates.)  Primarily because of confidentiality requirements, many
of the three-digit industry categories are not shown separately in the other
tables in this publication.  However, the individual industries included in an
industry group shown in the other tables may be determined, and their relative
sizes assessed, by referring to table II.A2. 

     Although each U.S. parent and foreign affiliate is classified in a single
industry based on its major activity, a given parent or affiliate may have had
activities in more than one industry.  Thus, the distribution of data by
industry of U.S. parent or foreign affiliate may differ from the distribution
that would have resulted if the data for each of a parent's or an affiliate's
activities were separately classified and the resulting data were summed, by
activity, across all parents or affiliates.  Compared with distributions by
industry of enterprise, distributions of the latter type are more indicative
of the actual activities in which the parents or affiliates are engaged. 

     Such activity-based distributions were obtained in the 1989 benchmark
survey for sales by, and employment of, U.S. parents; for foreign affiliates,
they were obtained only for sales.  Sales by each parent and affiliate were
required to be distributed among three-digit industries.  Each U.S. parent was
further required to distribute its employment among those industries in which
it also had sales.  By summing the data for a given industry across
parents and affiliates, one can derive the data disaggregated by industry of
sales.  The distribution by industry of sales is an activity-based
distribution that roughly approximates the distribution that would have
resulted if the data were reported and classified at the establishment (or
plant), rather than the enterprise, level.

     In table 6, U.S. parents' sales and employment disaggregated by industry
of sales are compared with their sales and employment disaggregated by
industry of parent, and foreign affiliates' sales disaggregated by industry of
sales are compared with their sales disaggregated by industry of affiliate. 
(For nonbank parents of nonbank affiliates, data by industry of sales
cross-classified by industry of parent are shown in table II.O2 for sales and
table II.P2 for employment; for nonbank affiliates of nonbank parents and for
majority-owned nonbank affiliates of nonbank parents, sales by industry of
sales cross-classified by industry of affiliate are shown in tables II.F25 and
III.F25, respectively.)

     For sales, differences between the distribution by industry of enterprise
and the distribution by industry of sales were much larger for U.S. parents
than for foreign affiliates, primarily because U.S. parents are more
diversified than their affiliates.  Their greater diversity, in part, reflects
the much greater degree of consolidation of U.S. parents.  As noted earlier,
parents were required to report on a fully consolidated domestic basis,
regardless of the industry classification of the individual domestic
subsidiaries included in the consolidation.  Foreign affiliates, in contrast,
could be consolidated only if they were in the same country and were
classified in the same three-digit industry.

     Estimation for Affiliates Filing the Short Form or Failing To Report

     In the benchmark survey, U.S. parents were required to file either a long
form or a short form for affiliates that had total assets, sales, or net
income (loss) greater than $3 million.  The long form (BE-10B(LF)), which
collected highly detailed information, had to be filed by nonbank U.S. parents
for each nonbank foreign affiliate with total assets, sales, or net income
(loss) greater than $15 million.  The most detail was collected for
majority-owned nonbank affiliates.  The short form (BE-10B(SF)), which
collected information on most balance of payments items but on only selected
financial and operating data items, had to be filed by nonbank parents for
each nonbank affiliate with total assets, sales, or net income (loss) greater
than $3 million but no more than $15 million and by U.S. bank parents for each
of their nonbank affiliates regardless of size.

     For nonbank affiliates of nonbank parents that reported on the short
form, BEA estimated items that appeared only on the long form in order to
present financial and operating data for all such affiliates in the same
detail.  For a given short-form affiliate, long-form items were
estimated based on data reported by a representative panel of long-form
affiliates.  The panel consisted of affiliates with total assets or sales
greater than $15 million but less than $250 million that were in the same
country and industry group as the affiliate being estimated.  For these
affiliates, ratios of items that appeared only on the long form to related
items that appeared on both forms were computed.  These ratios were then used
to estimate the missing long-form items for short-form affiliates.

     A total of 7,838 nonbank affiliates of nonbank parents filed short forms. 
Although these affiliates accounted for 44.0 percent of all nonbank affiliates
of nonbank parents, they accounted for only a minor portion of the nonbank
affiliate of nonbank parent universe in terms of value--3.6 percent of total
assets, 4.2 percent of sales, and 9.4 percent of employment.

     BEA also estimated data for some nonbank affiliates that did not file a
benchmark survey report even though they met the criteria for filing.  The 275
affiliates covered by these estimates were those for which BEA had a report in
another direct investment survey that could serve as a basis for estimation. 
These affiliates also accounted for only a minor portion of the nonbank
universe in terms of value--1.2 percent of total assets, 1.1 percent of sales,
and 1.1 percent of employment.  The estimation of data for these affiliates,
which is a departure from the practice in previous benchmark surveys of U.S.
direct investment abroad, ensured that the 1989 data were as complete as
possible.


     In addition to estimating long-form data for short-form affiliates and
data for affiliates that did not file a report, BEA also estimated data for
items that were not reported or were reported incorrectly on the forms that
were filed.  The degree of estimation varied from item to item.  In some
cases, reporters had difficulty supplying the required information because the
data were not easily accessible or were unavailable from their financial
accounting records.  In particular, data on trade and employment were subject
to a higher degree of estimation than other items.

                 Number of U.S. Parents and Foreign Affiliates

     The results published here include reported or estimated data for 2,272
consolidated U.S. parent companies and 18,899 foreign affiliates.  The number
of U.S. parents and foreign affiliates whose data are included in this
publication is larger than the number included in the estimates for the past
few years. 

     Parents were added to the reporting universe either because they
established or acquired foreign affiliates for the first time in 1989 or
because they were first identified as parents in the 1989 benchmark survey
even though they had foreign affiliates prior to 1989.  The latter parents
either were exempt from reporting in prior annual surveys or should have
reported but for some reason did not.  Partly offsetting these additions to
the reporting universe were a significant number of parents and affiliates
that left the universe since the last benchmark survey because they had been
sold, liquidated, or merged or consolidated with another U.S. parent or
foreign affiliate.  Although incorporation of the new information on parents
and affiliates that entered or left the universe since the last benchmark
survey will improve BEA's data for 1989 forward, it has resulted in a break in
series between 1988 and 1989.  BEA plans to revise its U.S. direct investment
abroad financial and operating and balance of payments data for 1983-88 to
incorporate information from the 1989 benchmark survey, but until the
revisions are completed, comparisons of the 1989 benchmark survey data with
data for earlier years should be made with caution.

     Financial and Operating Data for Foreign Affiliates and U.S. Parents

     Financial and operating data focus on the overall operations of U.S.
parents and their affiliates.  They include, among other things, data on
balance sheets and income statements; sales of goods and services; external
financial position; property, plant, and equipment; employment and employee
compensation; U.S. merchandise trade; and research and development
expenditures.

     For foreign affiliates, financial and operating data were collected in
parts I, II, IV, and V of the BE-1OB(LF) and (SF) forms (and in part II of the
BE-1OB BANK form).  The most detail--covering all of the types of data listed
above--was obtained for majority-owned nonbank affiliates reported on the BE-
10B(LF).  (A majority-owned affiliate is one in which the combined direct and
indirect ownership interest of all U.S. parents exceeds 50 percent.)  For
other nonbank affiliates reported on the BE-10B(LF), complete balance sheets
and income statements were obtained; however, among the other types of
financial and operating data, only seven items were requested--U.S.
merchandise exports shipped to affiliates by U.S. parents and by other U.S.
persons; U.S. merchandise imports shipped by affiliates to U.S. parents and to
other U.S. persons; property, plant, and equipment expenditures; total
employment; and total employee compensation.  For nonbank affiliates reported
on the BE-10B(SF), condensed balance sheets and income statements and 12 other
financial and operating data items were obtained.  (As stated earlier, BEA
estimated items that appeared only on the long form in order to present
financial and operating data for all nonbank affiliates, whether reported on
the BE-10B(LF) or (SF), in the same detail.)  The least detail overall--a
total of only 12 items--was obtained for bank affiliates.

     For U.S. parents, financial and operating data were collected in part II
of the BE-1OA (or BE-10A BANK) form.  As in the case of affiliates, much more
detail was obtained for nonbank parents than for bank parents.  Nonbank
parents had to provide complete balance sheets and income statements and
considerable detail for some of the other types of financial and operating
data, such as sales of goods and services; technology; property, plant, and
equipment; employment and employee compensation; and U.S. merchandise trade. 
Bank parents, in contrast, had to complete only five items.

     The financial and operating data for foreign affiliates are not adjusted
for percentages of U.S. ownership.  Thus, for example, the employment data
include all employees of each affiliate, even though the U.S. parent may own
less than 100 percent of the affiliate.

     Most of the concepts and definitions used in reporting the financial and
operating data can be found on the BE-10 forms or in the Instruction Booklet
to the forms, both of which are reproduced in the appendix to this
publication.  The following discussion focuses on conceptual, definitional, or
statistical issues that require further explanation or that are not covered in
the forms or the Instruction Booklet.

General validity of data

     The financial and operating data reported for foreign affiliates and U.S.
parents were required to pass a large number of computerized edit checks.  The
data were further reviewed by BEA for consistency with related data from other
parts of the report form for the same affiliate or parent, with comparable
data reported by other affiliates or parents, with data provided in related
report forms for past years, and with data available from outside sources.  As
a result of this edit and review process, a number of changes to the reported
data were made, usually after consultation with reporters.  However, some data
items on the forms were not integrated with, or related to, data from other
parts of the forms and could not be checked thoroughly.  Consequently, these
data are more likely to be subject to both reporting errors and underreporting
than the integrated data.  Particularly subject to error and underreporting
were the data for bank parents and affiliates,  the seven selected items
listed earlier for nonbank affiliates that were not majority-owned, and the
data on employment, trade, technology, production royalty payments, taxes
other than income and payroll taxes, and subsidies for nonbank parents and
majority-owned nonbank affiliates.

     In some cases, reporters had difficulty supplying the required
information because the data were not easily accessible or were unavailable
from their financial accounting records.  Data on trade and employment were
especially difficult for reporters to provide.  For these data, reporters
often made estimates, the quality of which is difficult to assess.


Sales of goods and services

     Sales are defined as gross sales minus returns, allowances, and discounts
or as gross operating revenues, both exclusive of sales and consumption taxes
levied directly on consumers, net value-added taxes, and excise taxes levied
on manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers.  

     Total sales by U.S. parents and by majority-owned nonbank foreign
affiliates had to be disaggregated to show sales of goods separately from
sales of services (and, for parents and majority-owned affiliates in finance
and insurance, separately from investment income).  For this purpose, sales of
goods were defined as those sales associated with industries coded in the 000,
100, 200, 300, or 500 series, except 070, 108, 124, 138, and 148; sales of
services were defined as those sales associated with industries coded in the
400, 600, 700, or 800 series, or in codes 070, 108, 124, 138, and 148.  (See
the Guide to Industry and Foreign Trade Classifications for International
Surveys, reproduced in the appendix, for a description of these codes.)  When
a sale consisted of both goods and services and the two components could not
be unbundled because, for example, the goods and services were not separately
billed, the total sale was classified as a good or service depending upon
which component accounted for the most value.

     To provide more accurate data on sales of services, information on
investment income of U.S. parents and majority-owned foreign affiliates in
finance and insurance was collected separately from sales of services for the
first time in the 1989 benchmark survey.  Finance and insurance companies
include investment income in sales because it is generated by a primary
activity of the company.  In most other industries, investment income is
considered an incidental revenue source and is included in the income
statement in a separate "other income" category. 

     Total sales by majority-owned nonbank affiliates had to be disaggregated
by destination to show local sales, sales to the United States, and sales to
other countries.  Local sales of a given affiliate are sales charged by the
affiliate to persons in its country of location.  As stated earlier, the
treatment of sales of services by destination for affiliates classified in
"International" differed in the 1989 benchmark survey from the treatment in
past years.  Prior to 1989, all sales by these affiliates, including those to
U.S. persons, were classified as "local" sales, whereas beginning with the
1989 benchmark survey, sales to U.S. persons are instead classified as such
and all other sales are classified as "local" sales.  

Employment and employee compensation

     In the benchmark survey, employment was defined as the number of
full-time and part-time employees on the payroll at the end of fiscal year
1989.  A count taken during, rather than at the end of, fiscal year 1989 was
acceptable if it was a reasonable proxy for the end-of-year number.  In either
case, if employment was unusually high or low because of temporary factors
(for example, a strike) or large seasonal variations, the number that
reflected normal operations, or an average for fiscal year 1989, was required.

     Employment of U.S. parents can be classified both by industry of parent
and by industry of sales.  As discussed in the industry classification
section, the latter is based on information supplied by each U.S. parent on
employment in the individual three-digit industries in which it also had
sales.  

     Employment of foreign affiliates can be classified by industry of
affiliate or by industry of U.S. parent but not by industry of sales.  The
information needed for the latter classification was not obtained in the 1989
benchmark survey, because earlier survey results had indicated that most
affiliates, unlike most U.S. parents, had sales and, therefore, employment in
only one three-digit industry.  In the 1989 benchmark survey, the distribution
of affiliate sales by industry of sales did not differ significantly from that
by industry of affiliate.  Thus, the distribution of affiliate employment by
industry of sales also probably does not differ significantly from that by
industry of affiliate.

     The employment and employee compensation data from the benchmark survey
can be used to compute compensation per employee or wages and salaries per
employee for U.S. parents and foreign affiliates.  The resulting rates,
however, may be misleading for two reasons.  First, in the employment data, a
part-time employee is counted the same as a full-time employee.  Thus,
compensation per employee and wages and salaries per employee may vary across
parents or affiliates simply because of differences in the share of part-time
workers in total employment.  Second, compensation (or wages and salaries) per
employee may be distorted by data for businesses or business segments acquired
or sold during the year.  For a newly acquired business, for example, although
BEA preferred that its employee compensation data cover the full year,
reported compensation data often covered only the portion of the year that the
business was in the direct investment universe.  Employment of the business,
however, was reported as of yearend.  When compensation data are only for a
portion of the year but employment is as of yearend, compensation per employee
and wages and salaries per employee are understated.  

     From the 1989 benchmark survey data, hourly compensation and wage rates
are better measures of compensation for foreign affiliates than either
compensation per employee or wages and salaries per employee.  The information
needed to derive hourly compensation and wage rates was collected in the
survey for production workers of foreign affiliates that had manufacturing
activities.  (In the 1982 benchmark survey, this information was also
collected for U.S. parents.  It was not collected in the 1989 benchmark survey
in order to reduce the reporting burden on U.S. companies.)  The data were
collected only for production workers because data on hours worked by
nonproduction workers are generally not maintained by reporters and because
aggregate hourly compensation and wage rates for the United States and foreign
countries, with which the benchmark survey data might be compared, are limited
to production workers.  Only a single number covering all manufacturing
industries in which there were sales had to be reported for hours worked by,
and compensation paid to, production workers in manufacturing.  Consequently,
no disaggregation of hourly compensation and wage rates by industry of sales
is possible.  However, as noted earlier, most affiliates had sales in only one
industry, and the distribution of affiliate sales by industry of sales did not
differ significantly from that by industry of affiliate as collected in the
1989 benchmark survey.  Thus, the distribution of hourly rates by industry of
sales also probably does not differ significantly from that by industry of
affiliate.

U.S. merchandise trade

     The concepts and definitions underlying the data on U.S. merchandise
trade of U.S. parents and foreign affiliates are very close to those used for
the all-U.S. merchandise trade data compiled by the Census Bureau.  Although
trade data were particularly difficult for reporters to provide, BEA's review
of the reported data indicates that, except as noted below, they conform well
to Census Bureau concepts and definitions. 

     In the benchmark survey, U.S. merchandise trade data had to be reported
on a "shipped" basis--that is, on the basis of when and to (or by) whom the
goods were physically shipped--in order for them to be comparable with the
official Census Bureau data.  However, most reporters keep their books on the
"charged" basis--that is, on the basis of when, where, and to (or by) whom the
goods were charged.  Although the two bases are usually the same, differences
between them can be substantial.  Such differences may arise, for example,
when a U.S. parent buys goods from an affiliate in country A and sells them to
an affiliate in country B, but the goods are shipped directly from country A
to country B.  When it records the transactions on its books, the U.S. parent
would show a purchase charged to it from country A and a sale charged by it to
country B.  If the parent's trade data were reported on the charged basis in
the benchmark survey, the purchase and sale would have appeared as a U.S.
import and U.S. export, respectively.  However, the goods never physically
entered or left the United States and, on a shipped basis, should have been
recorded neither as a U.S. import nor as a U.S. export.

     Based on its review, BEA believes most data were reported on a shipped
basis, rather than on a charged basis.  However, some reporters had difficulty
obtaining data on a shipped basis, which usually required use of shipping
department invoices rather than accounting records.  If BEA determined that
the data were reported on a charged basis and that these data were likely to
differ materially from data reported on a shipped basis, it required revised
reports to be filed.  However, some cases of erroneous reporting were probably
not identified.  

     Another difference between the trade data in this publication and the
Census Bureau trade data is that the former are on a fiscal year basis while
the latter are on a calendar year basis.  This difference could be an
important source of noncomparability between the two sets of data, but the
extent of such noncomparability is unknown.  Further differences may arise
from the fact that the trade data come from two different sources:  The BEA
data are based on company records, whereas the Census Bureau data are compiled
from export and import documents filed by shippers with the U.S. Customs
Service on each individual transaction.  In some cases, the timing, valuation,
origin or destination, shipper, and product involved in a given export or
import transaction may have been recorded differently on company records and
on the customs export and import documents.

     In this publication, exports and imports of U.S. parents and foreign
affiliates are disaggregated into 12 product categories, based on the Standard
International Trade Classification, Revision 2 (United Nations Statistical
Papers, Series M, No. 34/Rev. 2: United Nations, 1975), hereinafter referred
to as the SITC.  (See the Guide to Industry and Foreign Trade Classifications
for International Surveys, pages 21-24, in the appendix for a description of
the categories used.)

     Several problems with the classification of trade by product in the
benchmark survey were observed.  One was in the classification of certain
parts and accessories for transportation equipment.  In the SITC, some
transport equipment parts that are shipped separately are included in "road
vehicles and parts" or in "other transport equipment," based on the part's end
use; other parts are included in SITC categories appropriate to the type of
part, based on the principal material from which it is made or on its general
function.  Some reporters had difficulty distinguishing in their records
between parts that should have been included in "road vehicles and parts" or
"other transport equipment" and parts that should have been included in other
categories.  BEA reviewed reports with large trade values and, after
discussions with reporters, revised those with incorrect reporting.  However,
reports with low values were not reviewed, and in some cases, reporters may
have erroneously included both types of parts in "road vehicles and parts" or
"other transport equipment."  Thus, these two categories may be overstated,
and other categories, particularly machinery, may be understated. 

     Total U.S. trade associated with U.S. parents and their foreign
affiliates consists of (1) trade between U.S. parents and their foreign
affiliates, (2) trade between other U.S. persons and foreign affiliates, and
(3) trade between U.S. parents and unaffiliated foreigners.  Data on trade
between U.S. parents and their foreign affiliates were collected on the BE-1OA
and BE-10B(LF) and (SF) forms; on the BE-1OA form, total trade of a given U.S.
parent with all of its foreign affiliates combined was reported, while on the
BE-1OB(LF) and (SF) forms, trade of the U.S. parent with only the individual
foreign affiliate covered by that form was reported.  In principle, the sum of
a U.S. parent's trade with each of its individual foreign affiliates, as
reported on the BE-1OB forms for those affiliates, should equal the parent's
total trade with all of its affiliates combined, as reported on the parent's
BE-1OA form.  In fact, however, the sum of the data from the affiliates'
BE-10B forms may not equal the total reported on their parent's BE-1OA form,
because of differences in timing and valuation and because the parent's BE-1OA
form may include data for affiliates that are exempt from being reported on
the BE-10B forms.  

     In this publication, the data on trade between parents and affiliates
used in computing total U.S. trade associated with U.S. parents and their
foreign affiliates are derived from the affiliates' BE-1OB forms rather than
from the U.S. parents' BE-1OA forms.  (However, the data derived from the
parents' BE-1OA forms are shown as an addendum.)  Data on trade between other
U.S. persons and foreign affiliates are also derived from the affiliates'
BE-1OB forms.  However, data on trade between U.S. parents and unaffiliated
foreigners are from the parents' BE-1OA forms.

     In this publication, BEA is showing, for the first time, separate data on
U.S. parent trade with foreign parent groups (FPG's).  A U.S. parent has an
FPG if the U.S. parent is, in turn, owned 10 percent or more by a foreign
person.  For a given U.S. parent, the FPG consists of (1) the foreign parent
of the U.S. parent, (2) any foreign person, proceeding up the ownership chain,
that owns more than 50 percent of the person below it, and (3) any foreign
person, proceeding down the ownership chain(s) of each of these members, that
is owned more than 50 percent by the person above it. 

            Direct Investment Position and Balance of Payments Data

     Direct investment position and balance of payments data cover U.S.
parents' positions in, and transactions with, their foreign affiliates; in
contrast, the direct investment financial and operating data, discussed
earlier, cover the overall activities of the parents and affiliates
themselves.  For foreign affiliates, the data include positions in, and
transactions with, them by all persons, not just their U.S. parents.  The U.S.
direct investment position abroad is equal to U.S. parents' equity in, and net
outstanding loans to, their foreign affiliates; foreign affiliates' total
assets, in contrast, are equal to the sum of (1) total owners' equity in
affiliates held by both U.S. parents and all other persons and (2) total
liabilities owed by affiliates to both U.S. parents and all other persons. 
For example, suppose that an affiliate is owned 80 percent by its U.S. parent
and that the affiliate has total owners' equity of $50 million and total
liabilities of $100 million (including $20 million owed to the parent).  In
this case, the affiliate's total assets would be $150 million (total owners'
equity of $50 million plus total liabilities of $100 million), and the
parents' position in the affiliate would be $60 million (80 percent of the $50
million of owners' equity plus the $20 million of intercompany debt).

     In the benchmark survey, data for the position and balance of payments
items were reported in part III of the BE-10B(LF) or (SF) (or the BE-10B BANK)
form.  The balance of payments items consist of transactions between parents
and their affiliates and of transactions between parents and other persons
that change the parents' equity in their affiliates.  The major items that
appear in the U.S. balance of payments accounts for U.S. direct investment
abroad are these:

     o Direct investment capital outflows,
     o Direct investment income,
     o Direct investment royalties and license fees, and
     o Other direct investment services.

     It should be noted that there are two types of adjustments made to the
balance of payments data presented here before the data are entered into the
U.S. international accounts.  First, as noted earlier, two of these
items--income and capital outflows--are not entered into the international
accounts at the reported book values until they are adjusted to reflect
current-period prices.

     Second, as discussed in the section on fiscal year reporting, the direct
investment position and balance of payments data collected in the 1989
benchmark survey and shown in this publication are on a fiscal year basis,
whereas the data in the U.S. balance of payments accounts and in BEA's annual
series on the direct investment position are on a calendar year basis.  Before
being incorporated into the balance of payments accounts and the series on the
position, the data from the 1989 benchmark survey will be adjusted to a
calendar year basis.  These adjusted data for 1989 will also be extrapolated
forward to derive universe estimates for subsequent calendar years, based on
sample data collected in BEA's quarterly surveys for those years.  The
adjusted 1989 data and the extrapolated estimates for calendar years 1990-92
are scheduled for publication in the June and August 1993 issues of the Survey
of Current Business.  As noted earlier, BEA also plans to revise its balance
of payments and direct investment position data for 1983-88 to incorporate
information from the 1989 benchmark survey.

     The balance of payments data included here differ from data from the 1982
benchmark survey because of methodological and definitional changes introduced
in June 1992 to make BEA's data more consistent with the international
standards recommended in the forthcoming fifth edition of the International
Monetary Fund's (IMF) Balance of Payments Manual and in the United Nations
System of National Accounts.  These changes include (1) the presentation of
receipts and payments of income, royalties and license fees, and other private
services before deduction of withholding taxes and (2) the removal of capital
gains and losses from direct investment income.  These and other changes are
explained in the sections that follow. 

U.S. direct investment position abroad

     As noted earlier, the U.S. direct investment position abroad is equal to
U.S. parents' equity in, and net outstanding loans to, their foreign
affiliates.  The position may be viewed as the U.S. parents' contribution to
the total assets of their foreign affiliates or as financing provided by U.S.
parents to their affiliates in the form of either equity or debt.  The data
are derived from the foreign affiliates' books at yearend.

     The direct investment position estimates published here are at book value
and are not adjusted to current value.  Thus, they largely reflect prices at
the time of investment rather than prices of the current period. Because
historical cost is the basis used for valuation in company accounting records
in the United States, it is the only basis on which companies can report data
in BEA's direct investment surveys.  It is also the only basis on which
detailed estimates of the position are available by country, by industry, and
by account.  (Elsewhere, however, BEA does provide aggregate estimates of the
position valued in current-period prices.)  For simplicity, all
subsequent references to the position are to the position on a historical-cost
(book-value) basis, unless otherwise stated.  

     U.S. parents' equity in incorporated foreign affiliates consists of the
U.S. parents' holdings of capital stock in, and other capital contributions
to, their affiliates and U.S. parents' equity in the retained earnings of
their affiliates.  Capital stock comprises all stock of affiliates, whether
common or preferred, voting or nonvoting.  Other capital contributions by U.S.
parents, also referred to as the "U.S. parents' equity in additional paid-in
capital," consist of capital, invested or contributed, that is not included in
capital stock, such as amounts paid for stock in excess of its par or stated
value, capitalizations of intercompany accounts (conversions of debt to
equity) that do not result in the issuance of capital stock, and donations. 
U.S. parents' equity in retained earnings is the U.S. parents' shares of the
undistributed earnings of their incorporated foreign affiliates.

     For most unincorporated affiliates, U.S. parents' were able to provide a
breakdown of owners' equity by type.  Thus, in tables showing U.S. parents'
equity in affiliates by type, the parents' equity in both incorporated and
unincorporated affiliates are shown together.  For those unincorporated
affiliates for which no breakdown of owners' equity by type was available, all
of the parents' equity in the affiliates was included in capital stock (which
includes additional paid-in capital and capital contributions) rather than in
retained earnings, because these affiliates usually remit all of their
earnings to the U.S. parent.  The U.S. parents' share in total owners' equity
(not broken down by type) is shown separately for incorporated and
unincorporated affiliates in addenda to the direct investment position tables.

     The U.S. parents' net outstanding loans to their foreign affiliates,
shown in the tables as the affiliates' net intercompany debt to U.S. parents,
consist of trade accounts and trade notes payable, other current liabilities,
and long-term debt owed by the affiliates to their U.S. parents, net of
similar items due to the affiliates from their U.S. parents.

     Intercompany accounts include the value of all capital leases and of
operating leases of more than 1 year between U.S. parents and their foreign
affiliates.  (Only long-term operating leases are included in intercompany
accounts to conform to U.S. data on merchandise trade, which also exclude
shipments under leases for periods of 1 year or less.)  The value of property
so leased to a foreign affiliate by its U.S. parent is included in affiliates'
payables, and the net book value of property so leased by a foreign affiliate
to its U.S. parent is included in affiliates' receivables.  Capital leases
recognize that title to the leased property will usually be transferred to the
lessee at the termination of the lease--similar to an installment sale. 
Operating leases have a term significantly shorter than the expected useful
life of the tangible property being leased, and there is usually an
expectation that the leased property will be returned to the lessor at the
termination of the lease.  For capital leases, the net book value of the
leased property is calculated according to GAAP.  Under GAAP, the lessee
records either the present value of the future lease payments or the fair
market value, whichever is lower; the lessor records the sum of all future
lease receipts.  For operating leases of more than 1 year, the value is the
original cost of the leased property less accumulated depreciation.


     For bank affiliates, the direct investment position is defined to include
only their parents' permanent debt and equity investment in them; similarly,
the direct investment flows that enter the U.S. balance of payments accounts
for these affiliates include only transactions related to such permanent
investment.  All other transactions and positions--mainly claims and
liabilities arising from the parents' and affiliates' normal banking
business--are excluded from the direct investment accounts because they are
included with other banking claims and liabilities in the portfolio investment
accounts.  The definition of permanent investment may vary somewhat from bank
to bank.  Examples of such investment are funds from parents that are used to
establish or acquire the affiliates or that finance the affiliates' purchases
of property, plant, and equipment.

     The relationship between a U.S. parent and its foreign affiliate may be a
two-way one, in which each may have debt and equity investment in the other. 
Thus, a U.S. parent may have investment in a foreign affiliate that, in turn,
has investment in it as a result of the affiliate's lending funds to, or
acquiring voting securities or other equity interest in, the U.S. parent.  As
discussed earlier, in the intercompany accounts of the position, affiliate
receivables from their U.S. parents (reverse debt investment) are netted
against affiliate payables to their U.S. parents.  The question arises
as to whether affiliates' equity investment in their U.S. parents (reverse
equity investment) should also be netted against the U.S. parents' equity
investment in them.  Conceptually, one can argue that reverse equity, as well
as debt, investment should be netted to obtain an accurate measure of the net
investment by U.S. parents in affiliates.  This was the treatment before 1977,
but in some instances, it resulted in double-counting among the various
accounts of the international investment position of the United States and in
the capital accounts of the U.S. balance of payments.  Therefore, since 1977,
reverse equity investment of foreign affiliates in their U.S. parents has not
been netted against analogous investment of U.S. parents in their affiliates. 
It is instead included either in the foreign direct investment position in the
United States if the affiliate's ownership in its U.S. parent is 10 percent or
more or in the foreign portfolio investment position in the United States if
the affiliate's ownership is less than 10 percent.  

     The direct investment position at the end of a year is equal to the
position at the beginning of the year plus the change in the position during
the year.  The change during the year is the sum of direct investment capital
outflows and valuation adjustments.  Direct investment capital outflows are
defined below.  Valuation adjustments are broadly defined to include all
changes in the position other than capital outflows.  There are three broad
types of valuation adjustments.  They are (1) currency translation
adjustments, (2) other capital gains or losses, and (3) "other" valuation
adjustments.  

     Currency translation adjustments to the position are made to reflect
changes in the exchange rates that are used to translate foreign affiliates'
foreign-currency-denominated assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars,
following the guidelines contained in FASB 52 described earlier.  Also, as
mentioned earlier in the section on translation adjustments, in June 1990, BEA
removed the capital gains and losses associated with currency translation from
direct investment income--and hence from reinvested earnings, a component of
both income and capital outflows--and reclassified them as valuation
adjustments to the direct investment position.  The reclassification from
capital outflows to valuation adjustments did not affect the total direct
investment position.

     In June 1992, all other capital gains and losses, whether realized or
unrealized, were removed from direct investment income (and reinvested
earnings) for balance of payments purposes and reclassified as valuation
adjustments to the position.  This change also had no effect on the total
position.  The change in treatment recognizes that, from an economic
accounting perspective, capital gains and losses are not considered income (or
returns) on investments, but are rather adjustments to the value of
investments (or capital).  The change makes BEA's data consistent with the
treatment of these gains and losses in the IMF's Balance of Payments Manual. 
It also makes direct investment income conform more closely to the "operating
income" concept used in the NIPA's.  Data were revised beginning with the year
1982. 

     "Other" valuation adjustments primarily reflect differences between
transactions values on U.S. parents' books, which are used by BEA to record
capital outflows, and book values on foreign affiliates' books, which are used
to record the position and, hence, changes in the position.  For example, they
include differences between the proceeds from and the book values of
affiliates that are sold or liquidated by U.S. parents, differences between
the purchase price and the book values of affiliates that are acquired by U.S.
parents, and writeoffs resulting from uncompensated expropriations of
affiliates.  

     In principle, the direct investment position could be based either on the
books of U.S. parents or on the books of foreign affiliates.  Traditionally,
it has been based on the foreign affiliates' books because the valuation
method used on affiliates' books--that is, historical cost--is usually fairly
consistent from affiliate to affiliate, while that used on U.S. parents' books
may vary from parent to parent.  For example, depending on their percentage of
ownership, some parents may use the cost method of valuing investments, while
others may use the equity method (if the cost method is used, the U.S.
parents' equity in retained earnings since acquisition or establishment would
be excluded).  Still other parents may use market values, or they may write
off the excess of market value over book value, either in whole or in part. 
In contrast to the position, most balance of payments flow items--equity
capital and intercompany debt outflows, distributed earnings, interest,
royalties and license fees, and charges for other services--are based on the
books of the U.S. parents.  This is mainly because, for balance of payments
purposes, transactions values--which may be available only from the U.S.
parents' books--are required.  (For example, when a U.S. parent purchases or
sells an affiliate's stock to or from an unaffiliated third party, the
transaction is recorded only on the parent's books, not on the affiliate's
books.)

Direct investment capital outflows

     Direct investment capital outflows consist of equity capital outflows,
reinvested earnings, and intercompany debt outflows.  This section first
defines these components and then discusses several topics concerning their
coverage, measurement, and presentation. 

     Equity capital outflows.--Equity capital outflows are net increases in
U.S. parents' equity in their foreign affiliates, whether incorporated or
unincorporated.  They exclude changes in equity that result from the
reinvestment of earnings, which are considered a separate component of direct
investment capital outflows.

     Increases in U.S. parents' equity in their foreign affiliates result from
the U.S. parents' establishment of new foreign affiliates, from their initial
acquisitions of 10-percent-or-more ownership interests in existing foreign
business enterprises, from their acquisitions of additional ownership
interests in existing foreign affiliates, and from capital contributions to
affiliates.  Such increases in equity are recorded as U.S. capital outflows. 
Decreases in equity result from liquidations of foreign affiliates, from
partial or total sales of ownership interests in foreign affiliates, and from
returns of capital contributions.  They include liquidating dividends, which
are a return of capital to U.S. parents upon the liquidation of affiliates or
the sale of affiliates' assets.  Decreases in equity are recorded as capital
inflows to U.S. parents and are netted against increases in equity to derive
the net increase in U.S. parents' equity in their foreign affiliates.

     Equity capital outflows are recorded at transactions values, based on the
books of U.S. parents.  Such outflows may differ from those based on the books
of foreign affiliates.  For example, as noted earlier, when a U.S. parent
purchases or sells capital stock from or to an unaffiliated third party, the
transaction is recorded only on the parent's books, not on the affiliate's
books.  Also, transactions values on U.S. parents' books reflect the actual
cost of ownership interests in affiliates that are acquired or sold by U.S.
parents, including any premium or discount; such values may differ from the
book values recorded on the affiliates' books.  

     Reinvested earnings.--Reinvested earnings of foreign affiliates are
earnings less distributed earnings.  Earnings are U.S. parents' shares in the
net income of their foreign affiliates, after provision for foreign income
taxes.  Net income and, therefore, earnings are taken from the books of the
foreign affiliate.  A U.S. parent's share in net income is based on its
directly held equity interest in the foreign affiliate.

     Earnings are included in direct investment income (see definition in the
next section) because they are income to the U.S. parent, whether they are
reinvested or remitted to the parent.  However, because earnings that are
reinvested are not actually transferred to the U.S. parent, but rather
increase the parent's investment in its affiliate, an entry of equal magnitude
but of opposite sign to that made in the direct investment income account is
made in the direct investment capital account.

     For incorporated foreign affiliates, distributed earnings are dividends
on common or preferred stock held by U.S. parents, before deduction of foreign
withholding taxes and whether paid out of current or past earnings.  Dividends
exclude stock and liquidating dividends.  Stock dividends are considered a
capitalization of retained earnings--a substitution of one type of equity
(capital stock) for another (retained earnings)--which reduces the amount of
retained earnings available for distribution and leaves total owners' equity
unchanged.  Liquidating dividends are excluded because they are a return of
capital rather than a remittance of earnings.  (Liquidating dividends are
recorded instead as inflows in the direct investment equity capital account.) 
For unincorporated affiliates, distributed earnings are earnings distributed
to U.S. parents, whether out of current or past earnings. 

     Distributed earnings are based on the books of U.S. parents.  Because
they are on an accrual basis, they are reported as of the date they are either
received from foreign affiliates or entered into intercompany accounts with
foreign affiliates, whichever occurred first.  Thus, for example, dividends
declared by a foreign affiliate, but not remitted because of exchange controls
or for other reasons, are included in distributed earnings when they are
entered into intercompany accounts with the affiliate; at the same time, an
offsetting intercompany debt outflow is recorded in the direct investment
capital account.  Distributed earnings are included whether they are paid in
cash, through debt creation, or in kind.

     Intercompany debt outflows.--Intercompany debt outflows consist of the
increase in U.S. parents' net intercompany account receivables from their
foreign affiliates during the year.  The increase is derived by subtracting
the net outstanding intercompany account balance at the end of the previous
year from the net outstanding balance at the end of the current year.  The net
balance at the end of a year is calculated as U.S. parents' receivables
(amounts due) from affiliates less U.S. parents' payables (amounts owed) to
affiliates.  When a U.S. parent lends funds to its foreign affiliate, the U.S.
parents' receivables increase; subsequently, when the affiliate repays the
principal owed to its U.S. parent, the U.S. parent's receivables from the
affiliate are reduced.  In parallel fashion, when a U.S. parent borrows funds
from its foreign affiliate, its payables increase; subsequently, when the U.S.
parent repays the principal owed to its affiliate, the U.S. parent's payables
to the affiliate are reduced.  Increases in U.S. parents' receivables from
their affiliates or reductions in U.S. parents' payables to their affiliates
give rise to U.S. capital outflows on intercompany debt accounts.  Likewise,
reductions in U.S. parents' receivables from their affiliates or increases in
U.S. parents' payables to their affiliates give rise to inflows on
intercompany debt accounts.

     Not all intercompany debt transactions reflect actual flows of funds. 
For example, when distributed earnings, interest, or royalties and license
fees accrue to a U.S. parent from its foreign affiliate, the full amount is
included as a receipt (inflow) of income or of royalties and license fees on
U.S. direct investment abroad.  If all or part of that amount is not actually
transferred to the U.S. parent, the amount not transferred is entered into the
intercompany account as an increase (outflow) in the U.S. parent's receivables
from its affiliate. 

     The net change in intercompany debt accounts includes changes in the net
book value of capital leases and of operating leases of more than 1 year
between U.S. parents and their foreign affiliates.  (See discussion in the
section on the direct investment position.)  When property is so leased by a
foreign affiliate from its U.S. parent, the net book value of the leased
property is treated as an increase in the U.S. parent's receivables from its
affiliate and is recorded as an intercompany debt outflow.  The subsequent
payment of principal on a capital lease, or of depreciation on an operating
lease, is a return of capital and, for property leased by the foreign
affiliate from its parent, is recorded as an intercompany debt inflow because
it reduces the U.S. parent's receivables from its affiliate.  (When property
is leased to a U.S. parent by its foreign affiliate, the flows recorded are
the reverse of the preceding.)

     Intercompany debt outflows, like equity capital outflows, are based on
the books of U.S. parents and may differ from those based on the books of
foreign affiliates.  For example, a U.S. parent's receivables from its
affiliate as recorded on the parent's books may not necessarily be equal to
the affiliate's payables to its parent as recorded on the affiliate's books,
because of differences in accounting or valuation.

     Coverage, measurement, and presentation.-- All intercompany debt flows
result from transactions between U.S. parents and their foreign affiliates,
including direct debt transactions between U.S. parents and their indirectly
owned foreign affiliates.  Equity capital flows, however, may result from
transactions between U.S. parents and unaffiliated foreigners that change U.S.
parents' equity in their foreign affiliates.  An example is a U.S. parent's
purchase of an affiliate's capital stock from an unaffiliated foreigner,
rather than from the affiliate itself.

     Direct investment capital outflows exclude the transfer of a direct
investment interest between two U.S. persons.  Such a transfer is excluded
because it does not change the nature of the investment interest; that is, it
remains a direct investment interest, although ownership of the direct
investment interest has shifted from one U.S. person to another.  (Any change
in the value of the U.S. direct investment position abroad, such as a
revaluation of the investment by the new U.S. parent, is treated as a
valuation adjustment.)  If, however, either U.S. person has a portfolio
(less-than-10-percent) investment interest before a transfer of equity that,
in connection with the transfer, becomes a direct investment interest, a
direct investment capital outflow and offsetting portfolio investment capital
inflow are recorded for the extinguished portfolio interest.  Similarly, if
either U.S. person had a direct investment interest before a transfer of
equity that, in connection with the transfer, becomes a portfolio investment
interest, a direct investment capital inflow is recorded to extinguish the
direct investment interest and an offsetting portfolio investment capital
outflow is recorded for the new portfolio interest.  

     Direct investment capital outflows exclude transactions between a foreign
affiliate and U.S. persons other than the affiliate's U.S. parent.  For
example, loans by a U.S. bank to a foreign affiliate in which the bank does
not have a direct investment ownership interest and loans by one U.S. parent
to another U.S. parent's foreign affiliate in which the first U.S. parent does
not have a direct investment ownership interest are excluded.  Such
transactions are included instead in the portfolio investment accounts.

     As noted earlier in the section on country classification, direct
investment capital outflows are classified by country of foreign affiliate,
even if the foreign affiliate is not itself a party to the transaction.  Thus,
for example, if a U.S. parent purchases an affiliate's capital stock from a
third-country transactor, such transactions are nevertheless classified in the
country of the affiliate because the resulting outflows change the U.S. direct
investment position in that country.  

     In cases where reverse investment exists, the treatment of reverse direct
investment capital flows is the same as that for the analogous accounts in the
direct investment position.  (See discussion in the section "U.S. direct
investment position abroad.")

     Equity capital and intercompany debt flows are disaggregated into several
subaccounts in the tables in this publication (see tables I.V1 and 2, II.V1
and 2, and III.V1 and 2).  Equity capital flows are disaggregated to show
increases in equity separately from decreases, and intercompany debt flows are
disaggregated to show flows resulting from changes in U.S. parents' payables
separately from flows resulting from changes in U.S. parents' receivables. 
Certain transactions may affect two of the major components of direct
investment capital outflows simultaneously and by exactly offsetting amounts. 
Such transactions are "grossed up"; that is, the outflows and the offsetting
inflows resulting from the transaction are recorded in the accounts for each
component rather than being netted to zero and not recorded in either account. 
However, because such gross flows are exactly offsetting, they have no net
effect on direct investment outflows as a whole.  An example of a transaction
that results in gross, but not net, flows is the capitalization of
intercompany debt (which gives rise to an intercompany debt inflow from, and
an equity capital outflow to, the same affiliate).

Direct investment income

     Direct investment income is the return on the U.S. direct investment
position abroad; that is, it is the U.S. parents' return on their debt and
equity investment in foreign affiliates.  It consists of earnings (the U.S.
parents' shares in the net income of their foreign affiliates) plus interest
on intercompany debt.  Interest is defined as interest received by U.S.
parents from their foreign affiliates, net of interest paid by U.S. parents to
their foreign affiliates.  Direct investment income is defined to be before 
deduction, or gross, of (foreign or U.S.) withholding taxes.  

     Direct investment income is recorded as accrued.  When funds are not
actually transferred to U.S. parents, offsetting entries are made in the
direct investment capital account.

     Direct investment income differs from earnings (as defined in the
previous section) because it is from the viewpoint of U.S. parents--that is,
it is the return the U.S. parents receive on their investment.  Earnings, in
contrast, are from the viewpoint of affiliates--that is, they are (the U.S.
parents' shares of) what the affiliates earn from their business.  Thus, to
derive direct investment income, interest on intercompany debt accounts is
added to earnings because it increases the U.S. parents' return.  Earnings are
the U.S. parents' return on their equity investment, while interest is the
U.S. parents' return on their debt investment in foreign affiliates.

     Interest is that received by, or credited to, U.S. parents on debt owed
to them by their foreign affiliates, less interest paid or credited by U.S.
parents on debt owed by them to their foreign affiliates.  Interest includes
net interest on leases between U.S. parents and foreign affiliates that are
capitalized (capital leases), because the outstanding capitalized value of
such leases is included in the intercompany-debt component of the direct
investment position.  Interest is reported as accrued and is included in
direct investment income whether paid in cash, through debt creation, or in
kind.

     In June 1992, BEA redefined direct investment income and earnings for
balance of payments purposes to exclude all capital gains and losses not
associated with currency translation adjustments, whether or not such gains
and losses are included in net income for income statement purposes.  (As
mentioned earlier, BEA had, in June 1990, already excluded currency
translation adjustments from direct investment income.)  


     Also in June 1992, BEA began to adjust its estimates of direct investment
income (and the reinvested earnings component of capital outflows) to reflect
current-period prices prior to entering them into the international accounts. 
However, these adjustments are made to direct investment income on a global
basis only and do not appear in the direct investment income tables in this
publication, which are disaggregated by country or by industry.

     BEA also changed its treatment of withholding taxes in June 1992. 
(Withholding taxes are taxes withheld by governments on income or other funds
that are distributed or remitted.)  Previously, direct investment income had
been measured after deduction (that is, net) of foreign withholding taxes on
distributed earnings received by U.S. parents from their affiliates and after
deduction of U.S. and foreign withholding taxes on interest.  In June 1992,
direct investment income was redefined to be before deduction (that is, gross)
of all withholding taxes.  The new treatment views taxes on direct investment
distributed earnings and interest as falling on the recipient and thus as
being paid across borders, even though, as an administrative convenience, the
funds are actually disbursed locally by the entity making the distribution or
payment that gave rise to the tax.  Thus, withholding taxes on distributed
earnings and on interest received by the U.S. parent are regarded as being
paid by the parent, not by the foreign affiliate.  Similarly, withholding
taxes on interest payments by the U.S. parent are recorded as paid by the
foreign affiliate, not by the U.S. parent.  Counterentries for these taxes are
made in the U.S. balance of payments accounts under unilateral transfers. 
This change in methodology responds to changing international guidelines for
compiling balance of payments accounts, as reflected in the forthcoming fifth
edition of the IMF's Balance of Payments Manual.

     For years other than benchmark years, BEA has not collected data on
withholding taxes on receipts and payments of interest, royalties and license
fees, and other private services.  (For some time, BEA has collected data on
withholding taxes on distributed earnings on its quarterly surveys of U.S.
direct investment abroad.)  Until BEA begins collecting data on these taxes
for nonbenchmark years, they must be estimated and will be shown in the U.S.
balance of payments accounts only on a global basis, not disaggregated by
country or industry. 

     Translation adjustments and other capital gains and losses are shown in
addenda to tables I.V1 and 2, II.V1 and 2, and III.V1 and 2; withholding taxes
are shown in addenda to tables I.W1 and 2, II.W1 and 2, and III.W1 and 2.

Direct investment royalties and license fees

     Direct investment royalties and license fees are receipts by U.S. parents
from, less payments by U.S. parents to, their foreign affiliates of fees for
the use or sale of intangible property or rights--such as patents, industrial
processes, trademarks, copyrights, franchises, designs, know-how, formulas,
techniques, manufacturing rights, and other intangible assets or proprietary
rights.  Both receipts and payments are before deduction, or gross, of
(foreign or U.S.) withholding taxes.  

     As with the components of income, and by the same reasoning, royalties
and license fees had previously been presented after deduction, or net, of
withholding taxes, but in June 1992, they were redefined to be gross of
withholding taxes.  Receipts and payments of royalty and license fees after
deduction of withholding taxes and the taxes themselves are shown as addenda
to tables I.X1 and 2, II.X1 and 2, and III.X1 and 2. 

     Also, in June 1992, BEA began recording U.S. parents' payments of
royalties and license fees in the balance of payments accounts as U.S. imports
of services.  Previously, these payments were netted against U.S. parents'
receipts of royalties and license fees, and the net amount was shown as U.S.
services exports.  In effect, the payments were deducted from exports rather
than added to imports.

     Receipts and payments of royalties and license fees are based on the
books of the U.S. parents and are reported as accrued.  When funds are not
actually transferred, offsetting entries are made in the intercompany debt
account with foreign affiliates.

Other direct investment services

     Other direct investment services transactions consist of receipts by U.S.
parents from, less payments by U.S. parents to, their foreign affiliates of
service charges, charges for the use of tangible property, and film and
television tape rentals.  Both receipts and payments are gross of (foreign or
U.S.) withholding taxes, are reported as accrued, and are based on the books
of U.S. parents.  

     Receipts and payments of other direct investment services had previously
been presented after deduction, or net, of withholding taxes, but in June
1992, they were redefined to be gross of withholding taxes.  Receipts and
payments of other direct investment services after deduction of withholding
taxes and the taxes themselves are shown as addenda to tables I.X4 and 5,
II.X4 and 5, and III.X4 and 5. 

     Also in June 1992, as with U.S. parent payments of royalties and license
fees, BEA began recording U.S. parent payments for other private services in
the balance of payments accounts as a U.S. import of services.  Previously,
these payments were recorded as deductions from U.S. services exports.

     Service charges.--Service charges consist of fees for services--such as
management, professional, or technical services--rendered between U.S. parents
and their foreign affiliates, whether in the form of sales of services or
reimbursements.  Sales of services are receipts for services rendered that are
normally included in sales or gross operating revenues in the income statement
of the seller.  Such receipts are included in sales if performance of the
service is a primary activity of the enterprise.  For example, if a U.S.
management consulting firm provides management consulting services to its
foreign affiliates, the revenues therefrom would normally be included in its
sales.

     Reimbursements are receipts for services rendered that are normally
included in "other income," rather than in sales, in the income statement of
the provider of the service.  Such receipts are included in "other income,"
rather than in sales, if performance of the service is not among the primary
activities of the enterprise; the service performed may, however, facilitate
or support the conduct of the enterprise's primary activities.  This would be
the case, for example, if a U.S. manufacturing firm occasionally provides
management, professional, technical, or other services to its foreign
affiliates on a fee basis.

     Reimbursements may take the form of allocated expenses or direct charges
for the services rendered.  Allocated expenses are types of overhead expenses
that are apportioned among the various divisions or parts of an enterprise. 
An example would be research and development assessments on foreign affiliates
by a U.S. parent for research and development the parent performs and shares
with its affiliates. 

     Charges for the use of tangible property.--Charges for the use of
tangible property include total lease payments under operating leases of less
than 1 year and net rent on operating leases of 1 year or more that have not
been capitalized.  From the lessors' viewpoint, total lease payments for
operating leases consist of two components: (1) Net rent, which covers
interest, administrative expenses, and profit, and (2) depreciation, which is
a return of capital.  For operating leases of more than 1 year, net rent is
included in "other direct investment services," and depreciation is included
as an intercompany debt flow in the direct investment capital account.  For
operating leases of 1 year or less, total lease payments--both net rent and
depreciation--are included in "other direct investment services" because the
value of property leased to or from foreigners for 1 year or less is excluded
from U.S. merchandise exports and imports in the U.S. balance of payments
accounts.  Because no export to or import by U.S. parents is recorded in the
merchandise trade account, no subsequent return of capital to or by U.S.
parents in the form of depreciation is recorded in the direct investment
capital account.  Such depreciation is instead considered part of rentals--a
receipt for services rendered by, rather than a return of capital to, the
lessor.

     Film and television tape rentals.--Film and television tape rentals are
rentals received by U.S. parents from, less rentals paid by U.S. parents to,
their foreign affiliates for the use or sale of film and television tapes. 
When such film and television tapes are shipped by U.S. parents to foreign
affiliates, receipts for the tapes are considered, for balance of payments
purposes, receipts for services rather than receipts for merchandise because
the value of the physical tapes themselves is usually incidental to the value
of the services--entertainment, education, etc.--that they provide.  Thus, the
value of film and television tape rentals is excluded from U.S. merchandise
trade and is included instead in "other direct investment services."

                               Table Arrangement

     As noted earlier, the amount and type of data available from the
benchmark survey depended on whether the foreign affiliates or U.S. parents
were banks or nonbanks and for nonbank affiliates, on whether they were
majority or minority owned.  Data could have been published, at different
levels of detail, for 15 possible groups of affiliates and their parents. 
Table 7 shows the 15 affiliate groups; selected data for the affiliates in
each group are shown in panel A, and selected data for each group's U.S.
parents are shown in the corresponding column of panel B.  Primarily because
of space and resource limitations, data are presented in the remainder of this
publication for only 5 of the 15 groups of affiliates and their parents: Group
I, all affiliates of all U.S. parents (column 1); group II, nonbank affiliates
of nonbank U.S. parents (column 7); group III, majority-owned nonbank
affiliates of nonbank U.S. parents (column 8); group IV, nonbank affiliates of
U.S. parents in banking (column 10); and group V, bank affiliates of all U.S.
parents (column 13). 

     In this publication, 170 different table formats are presented.  Not all
of the formats are published for each affiliate group.  In some cases the
necessary data were not collected; in others, confidentiality requirements or
space limitations precluded publication of certain formats for a given
affiliate group even though the data were available.  In total, 35 tables are
included for group I, 82 for group II, 143 for group III, 2 for group IV, and
1 for group V.

     The list of tables that follows indicates the table formats included in
this publication for each of the five affiliate groups.  The heading shows the
five groups; the stub lists the different table formats.  An "X" in the column
for a given affiliate group means that the listed table format is published
for the affiliates in that group or for their U.S. parents.

     The number of a given table consists of (1) a Roman numeral (I, II, III,
IV, or V) to indicate the affiliate group covered, (2) a capital letter to
indicate the general subject matter (where letters A-J indicate that the table
contains foreign affiliate financial and operating data; K-S, U.S. parent
financial and operating data; and T-X, direct investment position and balance
of payments data), and (3) an Arabic numeral to indicate the specific subject
matter of the table.  Thus, table I.B5 covers all affiliates of all U.S.
parents (group I), relates generally to affiliates' balance sheets, and
provides data specifically on total assets disaggregated by country and
cross-classified by major industry.  If a given table format is published for
more than one affiliate group, it will have the same letter and Arabic numeral
designation (to indicate that the general and specific subject matters of the
tables are the same), but different Roman numerals (to indicate that different
affiliate groups are being covered).  For example, table III.B5 has the same
format and the same general and specific subject matters as table I.B5, but it
covers majority-owned nonbank affiliates of nonbank U.S. parents (group III),
rather than all affiliates of all U.S. parents (group I).

     All tables for group I are presented first, followed by tables for groups
II, III, IV, and V, in that order.  The group covered is indicated in the
"running header" at the top of each page.  It should be noted that data for
U.S. parents of group IV affiliates (that is, for U.S. parents in banking that
have nonbank foreign affiliates) are shown in column 10, panel B, of
methodology table 7.  Also, data for group V affiliates (that is, for bank
affiliates of all U.S. parents) are shown in the "banking" industry line or
column in the group I tables for all affiliates.  The data for group IV bank
parents and group V bank affiliates are not repeated in the group IV and group
V tables.

     When a given table format is not shown for an affiliate group, the
numbering of tables for that group may not be consecutive.  For example, the
first table presented for group I affiliates is table I.A3 because the formats
for tables I.A1 and 2 are not presented.

                            General Notes to Tables

o The estimates are on a fiscal year (FY) basis; an affiliate's fiscal year is
  defined as the financial reporting year that ended in that calendar year. 
  Unless otherwise specified, all balances are as of the close of FY 1989.
o Detail may not add to totals because of rounding.
o An asterisk "(*)" indicates a value between -$500,000 and +$500,000, or fewer
  than 50 employees, as appropriate. 
o A "(D)" indicates that the data in the cell have been suppressed to avoid
  disclosure of data of individual companies. 
o A "majority-owned nonbank affiliate" is a nonbank affiliate in which the
  combined direct and indirect ownership interest of all U.S. parents exceeds 50
  percent. 
o The designation "by country" in a table title indicates that data are
  disaggregated by country of foreign affiliate. 
o Unless otherwise specified, the designation "by industry" in a table title  
  indicates that the data are disaggregated by industry of foreign affiliate.
o For tables that do not show every individual country or industry, the
  individual countries or industries included in a country or industry group
  shown in the heading or stub may be ascertained by referring to table II.A1
  (for countries) or table II.A2 (for industries).  The industries listed in
  table II.A2 are described in BEA's Guide to Industry and Foreign Trade
  Classifications for International Surveys (see appendix).
o The country category "International" consists of affiliates that have
  operations spanning more than one country and that are engaged in petroleum
  shipping, other water transportation, or oil and gas drilling.
o Eastern Europe comprises Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, the German
  Democratic Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and the Union of Soviet
  Socialist Republics.  (This list reflects country names and definitions as
  they existed in 1989.)
o The European Communities (12) comprises Belgium, Denmark, Germany (Federal
  Republic of), France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands,
  Portugal, Spain, and the United Kingdom. 
o OPEC is the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. The members of OPEC
  are Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria,
  Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Venezuela.
o The major industry classification "petroleum" includes all of the various
  three-digit BEA petroleum subindustries.  All other major industries exclude
  these petroleum subindustries.  For example, mining excludes crude petroleum
  (no refining) and gas; manufacturing excludes petroleum refining and coal
  products; retail trade excludes gasoline service stations; and wholesale trade
  excludes petroleum wholesale trade. 
o The footnotes to all tables follow the last table and are arranged according
  to the table to which they refer.

                            Footnotes to Tables

Table I.K2: 
  1. A U.S. parent that had affiliates in more than one country or industry is
counted once in each country or industry in which it had affiliates.  Thus, the
numbers appearing in individual country/industry cells do not add to the
subtotals and totals.

Tables I.U1, I.U2, and I.U5:
  1. Includes common and preferred stock of affiliates owned by U.S. parents and
U.S. parents' equity in affiliates' additional paid-in capital.  Also includes
U.S. parents' equity in those unincorporated affiliates for which detail on
equity by type could not be provided.
  2. U.S. parents' equity in retained earnings and other reserves. 
  3. Consists of the U.S. parents' share in the cumulative amount of capital
gains and losses associated with currency translation adjustments--that is, gains
and losses that arise because of changes from the end of one accounting period
to the next in exchange rates applied in translating affiliates' assets and
liabilities from their functional currencies into U.S. dollars.
  
Tables I.V1 and I.V2:
  1. A net increase in U.S. parents' equity in affiliates is a balance of
payments outflow; a net decrease is a balance of payments inflow.  
  2. Equals earnings (that is, the U.S. parents' share in the earnings of their
foreign affiliates) less distributed earnings (that is, earnings distributed to
U.S. parents before deduction of foreign withholding taxes).
  3. An increase in U.S. parents' payables is a decrease in net intercompany
accounts and, therefore, a U.S. balance of payments inflow.
  4. Consists of the U.S. parents' share in the amount of capital gains and
losses associated with currency translation adjustments--that is, gains and
losses that arise because of changes from the end of one accounting period to the
next in exchange rates applied in translating affiliates' assets and liabilities
from their functional currencies into U.S. dollars.

Tables I.W1, I.W2, and I.W5:
  1.  Excludes capital gains and losses.  Also, as presented here, is not
adjusted to reflect current-period prices.  Prior to being entered into the
international accounts, adjustments to reflect current-period prices are made to
direct investment income on a global basis only.  These adjustments do not appear
in the direct investment income tables that are disaggregated by country or by
industry.
  2. U.S. parents' shares in the net income of their affiliates, before deduction
of foreign withholding taxes on distributed earnings.  
  3. Earnings distributed to U.S. parents before deduction of foreign withholding
taxes.
  4. Interest received by, or credited to, U.S. parents on debt owed to them by
their affiliates, less interest paid, or credited, by U.S. parents on debt owed
by them to their affiliates, both before deduction of (foreign or U.S.)
withholding taxes.
  
Tables I.X1 and I.X2:
  1. Receipts are before deduction of foreign withholding taxes.
  2. Payments are before deduction of U.S. withholding taxes.

Tables I.X4 and I.X5:
  1. Receipts are before deduction of foreign withholding taxes.
  2. Consists of fees for services--such as management, professional, or
technical services--rendered between U.S. parents and their foreign affiliates,
whether in the form of sales of services or reimbursements.  Sales of services
are fees for services rendered that are normally included in sales in the income
statement of the seller; reimbursements are fees for services rendered that are
normally included in "other income" in the income statement of the provider of
the service.  See the methodology for further explanation.
  3. Payments are before deduction of U.S. withholding taxes.
 
Tables II.B2, II.B4, and II.B14: 
  1. Includes common and preferred stock and additional paid-in-capital, less
treasury stock.  Also includes U.S. parents' equity in those unincorporated
affiliates for which detail on equity by type could not be provided.
  2. Includes retained earnings and other reserves.
  3. Consists of the cumulative amount of capital gains and losses associated
with currency translation adjustments--that is, gains and losses that arise
because of changes from the end of one accounting period to the next in exchange
rates applied in translating affiliates' assets and liabilities from their
functional currencies into U.S. dollars. 

Tables II.D6 and II.D7: 
  1. Includes the net book value of "transfers in" of property, plant, and
equipment to majority-owned affiliates only.  Data on "transfers in" of
minority-owned affiliates were not collected; however, they are probably
insignificant.  For a given affiliate, "transfers in" are from its U.S. parent
or from other foreign affiliates of its U.S. parent.  

Tables II.E1, II.E2, and II.E8:
  1. Consists of gains (losses), net of income tax effects, resulting from (1)
the sale, disposition, or revaluation of assets; (2) the remeasurement of the
foreign affiliates' assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies
other than the affiliate's functional currency, to reflect changes in foreign
exchange rates during the period; (3) transaction gains (losses) taken to income
in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No.52 (FASB
52); (4) and all other realized and unrealized gains (losses), net of income tax
effects, that under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles are to be
included in income.
  2. Consists of unrealized gains (losses), net of income tax effects, that under
GAAP are not included in the determination of net income.  
  
Table II.F24:
  1. For industry classification, each foreign affiliate was required to
disaggregate its sales by three-digit International Surveys Industry code; the
affiliate was then classified in the industry in which its sales were largest
(see methodology for discussion of industry classification).  When sales are
disaggregated by industry of affiliate, total sales of a given affiliate are
shown in the single industry in which the affiliate was classified; when
disaggregated by industry of sales, they are distributed among all the industries
in which the affiliate reported sales (that is, sales associated with each
industry of sales are shown in that industry regardless of the affiliate's
industry of classification).
  2. In the breakdown of foreign affiliates' sales by industry of sales, only the
five largest sales categories had to be specified.  If an affiliate had sales in
more than five industries, the distribution of its sales in the specified
industries would have covered less than 100 percent of its total sales.  Sales
in all unspecified industries combined are shown in this column.

Table II.H1:
  1. Equals column 2, table II.Q2.
  2. Equals column 3, table II.Q2.
  3. Equals column 4, table II.Q2.
  4. Equals column 2, table II.Q5.
  5. Equals column 3, table II.Q5.
  6. Equals column 4, table II.Q5.

Table II.K1:
  1. Includes capitalized expenditures for land, timber, mineral and like rights
owned, structures, machinery, equipment, special tools, and other depreciable
property; construction in progress; and capitalized and expensed tangible and
intangible exploration and development costs (but not the costs of other types
of intangible assets) and land held for resale.

Table II.M1:
  1. Includes "transfers in" of property, plant, and equipment.
  2. Includes restatement due to a change in the entity.

Table II.M2:
  1. Expenditures include the net book value of "transfers in" of property,
plant, and equipment.  
  2. Equals column 3 of table II.M1. 

Table II.N1:
  1. Consists of gains (losses), net of income tax effects, resulting from (1)
the sale, disposition, or revaluation of assets; (2) the remeasurement of the
U.S. parents' foreign-currency-denominated assets and liabilities due to changes
in foreign exchange rates during the period; (3) transaction gains (losses) taken
to income in accordance with FASB 52; and (4) all other realized and unrealized
gains (losses), net of income tax effects, that under U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles are to be included in income.  

Table II.O1:
  1. Sales of goods are defined as sales generated by activities characteristic
of the following group of industries:  Agriculture, except agricultural services;
mining, except mining services; petroleum, except petroleum services;
construction; manufacturing; and wholesale and retail trade.
  2. Sales of services are defined as sales generated by activities
characteristic of the following group of industries:  The "services" division of
the Standard Industrial Classification (and the International Surveys Industry
Classification) system, petroleum services, finance, insurance, real estate,
agricultural services, mining services, transportation, communication, and public
utilities. 
  3. Consists of investment income that is included in sales (or gross operating
revenues) in the income statement.  In finance and insurance, parents generally
include investment income in sales because it is generated by a primary activity
of the company.  In most other industries, parents generally consider investment
income an incidental revenue source and include it in the income statement in a
separate "other income" category; in such cases, investment income is not
included in parents' sales or in this column.

Table II.O2:
  1. For industry classification, each U.S. parent was required to disaggregate
its sales by three-digit International Surveys Industry code; the U.S. parent was
then classified in the industry in which its sales were largest (see methodology
for discussion of industry classification).  When sales are disaggregated by
industry of U.S. parent, total sales of a given U.S. parent are shown in the
single industry in which the parent was classified; when disaggregated by
industry of sales, they are distributed among all the industries in which the
U.S. parent reported sales (that is, sales associated with each industry of sales
are shown in that industry regardless of the U.S. parent's industry of
classification).
  2. In the breakdown of U.S. parents' sales by industry of sales, only the eight
largest sales categories had to be specified.  If a given U.S. parent had sales
in more than eight industries, the distribution of its sales in the specified
industries would have covered less than 100 percent of its total sales.  Sales
in all unspecified industries combined are shown in this column.

Table II.P2:
  1. For industry classification, each U.S. parent was required to disaggregate
its sales by three-digit International Surveys Industry code; the parent was then
classified in the industry in which its sales were largest (see methodology for
discussion of industry classification).  When employment is disaggregated by
industry of parent, total employment of a given parent is shown in the single
industry in which the parent was classified; when disaggregated by industry of
sales, employment is distributed among all the industries in which the parent
reported sales (that is, the number of employees associated with each industry
of sales is shown in that industry regardless of the parent's industry of
classification).
  2. In the breakdown of U.S. parents' employment by industry of sales, only
employment in the eight largest sales categories had to be specified.  If a given
U.S. parent had employment in more than eight industries, the distribution of its
employment in the specified industries would have covered less than 100 percent
of its total employment.  Employment in all unspecified industries combined is
shown in this column.  In addition, this column includes employees working in
central administrative offices or headquarters.

Table II.Q1:
  1. Applies only to U.S. parent companies that are themselves U.S. affiliates
of foreign companies.  The foreign parent group consists of (1) the foreign
parent of a U.S. parent, (2) any foreign person, proceeding up the foreign
parent's ownership chain, that owns more than 50 percent of the person below it,
and (3) any foreign person, proceeding down the ownership chain(s) of each of
these members, that is owned more than 50 percent by the person above it. 
  2. Does not equal the total in column 3, which is derived from data reported
on affiliates' forms, because of differences in timing and valuation and the
inclusion of data for affiliates covered on U.S. parents' forms but exempt from
being reported on affiliates' forms.

Table II.Q2:
  1. See footnote 1 to table II.Q1.
  2. See footnote 2 to table II.Q1.
  3. A U.S. parent was required to disaggregate its U.S. exports to "other"
foreigners (that is, foreigners other than foreign affiliates) by country of
destination only if its exports to a given country were $250,000 or more.  A U.S.
parent's exports to "other" foreigners in all countries to which its exports were
less than $250,000 were reported as a single item and are classified in
"unallocated."

Table II.Q4:
  1. See footnote 1 to table II.Q1.
  2. See footnote 2 to table II.Q1.

Table II.Q5:
  1. U.S. imports shipped by "other" foreigners (that is, foreigners other than
foreign affiliates) to U.S. parents were not disaggregated by country.  Thus,
data in column 11, and hence in columns 1, 12, 13, and 14, are available only for
all countries combined.  
  2. See footnote 1 to table II.Q1.
  3. U.S. imports shipped by all foreign affiliates to U.S. parents as reported
on U.S. parents' forms were not disaggregated by country.  Thus, data in column
15 are available only for all countries combined.
  4. See footnote 2 to table II.Q1.

Table II.R2:
  1. All-industries total equals all-countries total in column 2 of table II.X1
and all-industries total in column 2 of table II.X2.
  2. All-industries total equals all-countries total in column 5 of table II.X1
and all-industries total in column 5 of table II.X2.

Table II.S1:
  1. Includes interest received from affiliates.
  2. Includes interest paid to affiliates, plus withholding taxes on such
interest.
  3. Includes sales, consumption, and excise taxes; property and other taxes on
the value of assets and capital; and any remaining taxes (other than income and
payroll taxes).  Also includes all payments of nontax liabilities (other than
production royalty payments), such as import and export duties, license fees,
fines, penalties, and similar items.

Tables III.B2, III.B4, and III.B14: 
  1. For table III.B2, comparable with the sum of columns 11 and 13 of table 20
in the 1983-88 annual survey publications; for table III.B4, comparable with the
sum of columns 11 and 13 of table 21 in the 1983-88 annual survey publications;
for table III.B14, comparable with the sum of columns 11 and 13 of table 25 in
the 1983-88 annual survey publications.  Current liabilities and long-term debt
were collected separately in the 1983-88 annual surveys, but they were combined
in the 1989 benchmark survey.
  2. See footnote 1 to table II.B2.
  3. See footnote 2 to table II.B2.
  4. See footnote 3 to table II.B2.

Table III.C1:
  1. Comparable with the sum of columns 3 and 4 of table 26 in the 1983-88 annual
survey publications.  These items were collected separately in the 1983-88 annual
surveys but were combined in the 1989 benchmark survey.  
  2. This item includes total owners' equity of those unincorporated affiliates
for which detail on equity by type could not be provided.  For these affiliates,
cumulative retained earnings--which are an internal, not an external, source of
funds--and translation adjustments were not reported separately and could not be
excluded.  
  3. This item was not collected in the 1988 annual survey; thus, the change   
for 1988-89 is not available.
  4. For all industries combined and for each of the selected industries shown,
data in this line, which represents the position with all transactors combined,
are related to data in tables III.B3 and III.B4 as follows:  Column 2 (of this
table) equals column 3 of table III.B4; column 3 equals column 8 of table III.B4;
column 4 equals column 4 and that part of column 14, table III.B3, that is
stocks, bonds, noncurrent receivables, and other equity investments.
  5. For all industries combined and for each of the selected industries shown,
data in this line, which represents the position with U.S. parents, are related
to data in table III.U2 as follows:  Column 2 (of this table) equals column 7 of
table III.U2; column 3 equals column 3; and column 4 equals column 8 less that
portion of column 8 that is the net book value of property, plant, and equipment
leased by foreign affiliates to their U.S. parents under operating leases of more
than 1 year.  For balance of payments purposes, the value of such leased
equipment is included in affiliates' receivables from U.S. parents, as shown in
column 8 of table III.U2.  However, in the affiliates' balance sheets, it is
normally included in the property, plant, and equipment account rather than in
affiliates' receivables.  Thus, it would not appear in column 4 of this table,
which includes receivables as reported in the balance sheet. 
  6. For the selected country or country group covered by this panel of table
III.C1, table-to-table references in footnote 4 above apply, except that
references to tables III.B3 and III.B4 should be replaced by references to the
relevant country or country group line of tables III.B1 and III.B2, respectively. 
For example, column 2 of the Canada panel of table III.C1 equals column 3 of the
Canada line of table III.B2.
  7. For the selected country or country group covered by this panel of table
III.C1, table-to-table references in footnote 5 above apply, except that
references to table III.U2 should be replaced by references to the relevant
country or country group line of table III.U1.  For example, column 2 of the
Canada panel of table III.C1 equals column 7 of the Canada line of table III.U1.

Table III.C2:
  1. See footnote 2 to table III.C1.
  2. See footnote 3 to table III.C1.
  3. For all industries combined and for each of the selected industries shown,
data in this line, which represents the position with all transactors combined,
are related to data in table III.B13 and III.B14 as follows:  Column 2 (of this
table) equals column 3 of table III.B14; column 3 equals column 8 of table
III.B14; column 4 equals column 4 and that part of column 14, table III.B13, that
is stocks, bonds, noncurrent receivables, and other equity investments.

Tables III.D1, III.D2, and III.D3:
  1. Includes the net book value of "transfers in" of property, plant, and
equipment.  For a given affiliate, "transfers in" are from its U.S. parent or
from other foreign affiliates of its U.S. parent.
  2. Includes restatements resulting from a change in the entity and revaluations
of property, plant, and equipment to a fair market or appraised value. 

Tables III.D4 and III.D5:
  1. See footnote 1 to table III.D1. 
  2. For table III.D4, column 2 equals column 3 of table III.D1; for table
III.D5, column 2 equals column 3 of table III.D2.

Tables III.D6 and III.D7:
  1. See footnote 1 to table III.D1.

Table III.D8:
  1. Consists of capital expenditures other than those for land, timber, and
mineral rights.

Tables III.E1, III.E2, and III.E8:
  1. See footnote 1 to table II.E1. 
  2. In the 1983-88 annual survey publications, included selling, general, and
administrative expenses.  Such expenses are now included instead with the costs
of goods sold in column 8. 
  3. Consists of unrealized gains (losses), net of income tax effects, that under
GAAP are not included in the determination of net income.  In the
1983-88 annual survey publications, this item also included changes during the
current year in the balance sheet's translation adjustment account resulting from
following FASB 52.  Such translation adjustments are now excluded from this item
and included instead in a separate component of owners' equity, entitled
"translation adjustments."  See the methodology for further discussion.

Table III.F1:
  1. Includes sales to the U.S. parent and its foreign affiliates; equals the sum
of columns 5 and 8.  
  2. Sales charged by an affiliate to persons in the country where the affiliate
is located.
  3. "Other" foreign countries are foreign countries other than the country where
the affiliate is located.
  4. See footnote 1 to table II.O1. 
  5. See footnote 2 to table II.O1. 
  6. Consists of investment income that is included in sales (or gross operating
revenues) in the income statement.  In finance and insurance, affiliates
generally include investment income in sales because it is generated by a primary
activity of the company.  In most other industries, affiliates generally consider
investment income an incidental revenue source and include it in the income
statement in a separate "other income" category; in such cases, investment income
is not included in affiliates' sales or in this line.

  NOTE.--This publication contains tables (in general subject matter groups T, U, V, W, and X) that show direct investment position and balance of payments data, as well as tables that show financial and operating data.  The
tables that show direct investment position and balance of payments data are not listed here, because they are outside the scope of the publications for 1990 forward and for 1983-88, which cover only financial and operating data.
Direct investment position and balance of payments data comparable with those in this publication, which are on a fiscal year basis, are not available (see text for discussion).  However, direct investment position and balance of
payments data are available on a calendar year basis for 1950-91 in other BEA publications.
  Also not listed here are tables covering the financial and operating data of all affiliates of all U.S. parents, nonbank affiliates of parents in banking, and bank affiliates of all parents.  These data are also outside 
the scope of the publications for 1990 forward and for 1983-88, which cover only financial and operating data of nonbank U.S. parents and their nonbank affiliates.
